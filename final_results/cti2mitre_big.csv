Strike to target commercial and Federal Government networks.', 'Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing tool used to conduct red team operations.', 'It contains a number of tools that complement the cyber threat actors exploitation efforts, such as a keystroke logger, file injection capability, and network services scanners.', 'CISA observed connections from a Federal Government

application attacks, and it is configured in a client/server relationship.', 'China Chopper contains security scanners and can be used to upload files and brute-force passwords.MimikatzCISA has observed the actors using Mimikatz during their operations.', 'This open-source tool is used to capture account credentials and perform privilege escalation with pass-the-hash attacks that allow an attacker to pass captured password hashes and authenticate to network devices.', '[12]The following sections list the ATT&CK Framework TTPs routinely employed by Chinese government-affiliated actors to conduct cyber operations as observed by CISA analysts.Initial AccessIn the last 12 months, CISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors use spearphishing emails with embedded links to actor-owned infrastructure and, in some cases, compromise or poison legitimate sites to enable cyber operations.CISA has observed the threat actors using theInitial Access[TA0001] techniques identified in table 6.Table 6: Initial access techniques observed by CISAMITRE IDNameObservationT1204.001User Execution: Malicious LinkCISA has observed indications that users have clicked malicious links embedded in spearphishing emails that the threat actors sentT1566.002Phishing: Spearphishing LinkCISA analyzed network activity of a Federal Government entity and concluded that the threat actors sent a malicious email weaponized with links.T1190Exploit Public-Facing ApplicationCISA has observed the actors leveraging CVE-2019-19781 to compromise Citrix Application Delivery Controllers.Cyber threat actors can continue to successfully launch these types of low-complexity attacksas long as misconfigurations in operational environments and immature patch management programs remain in placeby taking advantage of common vulnerabilities and using readily available exploits and information.ExecutionCISA analysts continue to observe beaconing activity indicative of compromise or ongoing access to Federal Government networks.', 'This beaconing is a result of cyber threat actors successfully completing cyber operations that are often designed around emergent vulnerabilities and reliant on existing exploitation tools, as mentioned in this document.CISA has observed Chinese MSS-affiliated actors using theExecution[TA0002] technique identified in table 7.Table 7: Execution technique observed by CISAMITRE IDNameObservationT1072Software Deployment ToolsCISA observed activity from a Federal Government IP address beaconing out to the threat actors C2 server, which is

attacks.']
