T1598,Adversaries may send spearphishing messages via third-party services to elicit sensitive information that can be used during targeting.
T1598,"In this scenario, adversaries send messages through various social media services, personal webmail, and other non-enterprise controlled services."
T1598,These services are more likely to have a less-strict security policy than an enterprise.
T1598,"As with most kinds of spearphishing, the goal is to generate rapport with the target or get the target's interest in some way."

T1566,Adversaries may send spearphishing messages via third-party services in an attempt to gain access to victim systems.
T1566,Spearphishing via service is a specific variant of spearphishing.
T1566,It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of third party services rather than directly via enterprise email channels.
T1566,Adversaries will create fake social media accounts and message employees for potential job opportunities.
T1566,"Doing so allows a plausible reason for asking about services, policies, and software that's running in an environment."
T1566,The adversary can then send malicious links or attachments through these services.
T1566,"A common example is to build rapport with a target via social media, then send content to a personal webmail service that the target uses on their work computer."
T1566,"This allows an adversary to bypass some email restrictions on the work account, and the target is more likely to open the file since it's something they were expecting."
T1566,"If the payload doesn't work as expected, the adversary can continue normal communications and troubleshoot with the target on how to get it working."

T1608,"Adversaries may upload, install, or otherwise set up capabilities that can be used during targeting."
T1608,"To support their operations, an adversary may need to take capabilities they developed  or obtained  and stage them on infrastructure under their control."
T1608,These capabilities may be staged on infrastructure that was previously purchased/rented by the adversary  or was otherwise compromised by them .
T1608,"Capabilities can also be staged on web services, such as GitHub or Pastebin."
T1608,"Staging of capabilities can aid the adversary in a number of initial access and post-compromise behaviors, including :
* Staging web resources necessary to conduct Drive-by Compromise when a user browses to a site."
T1608,* Staging web resources for a link target to be used with spearphishing.

T1037,Adversaries may use startup items automatically executed at boot initialization to establish persistence.
T1037,Startup items execute during the final phase of the boot process and contain shell scripts or other executable files along with configuration information used by the system to determine the execution order for all startup items.
T1037,"This is technically a deprecated technology , and thus the appropriate folder, /Library/StartupItems isn’t guaranteed to exist on the system by default, but does appear to exist by default on macOS Sierra."
T1037,"A startup item is a directory whose executable and configuration property list , StartupParameters.plist, reside in the top-level directory."
T1037,An adversary can create the appropriate folders/files in the StartupItems directory to register their own persistence mechanism .
T1037,"Additionally, since StartupItems run during the bootup phase of macOS, they will run as the elevated root user."
T1037,jRAT can list and manage startup entries.
T1528,Adversaries can steal user application access tokens as a means of acquiring credentials to access remote systems and resources.
T1528,This can occur through social engineering and typically requires user action to grant access.
T1528,An application desiring access to cloud-based services or protected APIs can gain entry using OAuth 2.0 through a variety of authorization protocols.
T1528,An example commonly-used sequence is Microsoft's Authorization Code Grant flow.
T1528,An OAuth access token enables a third-party application to interact with resources containing user data in the ways requested by the application without obtaining user credentials.
T1528,Adversaries can leverage OAuth authorization by constructing a malicious application designed to be granted access to resources with the target user's OAuth token.
T1528,"The adversary will need to complete registration of their application with the authorization server, for example Microsoft Identity Platform using Azure Portal, the Visual Studio IDE, the command-line interface, PowerShell, or REST API calls."
T1528,"Then, they can send a link through Spearphishing Link to the target user to entice them to grant access to the application."
T1528,"Once the OAuth access token is granted, the application can gain potentially long-term access to features of the user account through Application Access Token."
T1528,"Adversaries have been seen targeting Gmail, Microsoft Outlook, and Yahoo Mail users."
T1528,"APT28 has used several malicious applications to steal user OAuth access tokens including applications masquerading as ""Google Defender"" ""Google Email Protection,"" and ""Google Scanner"" for Gmail users."
T1528,"They also targeted Yahoo users with applications masquerading as ""Delivery Service"" and ""McAfee Email Protection""."
T1539,An adversary may steal web application or service session cookies and use them to gain access to web applications or Internet services as an authenticated user without needing credentials.
T1539,Web applications and services often use session cookies as an authentication token after a user has authenticated to a website.
T1539,"Cookies are often valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used."
T1539,"Cookies can be found on disk, in the process memory of the browser, and in network traffic to remote systems."
T1539,"Additionally, other applications on the targets machine might store sensitive authentication cookies in memory ."
T1539,Session cookies can be used to bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols.
T1539,There are several examples of malware targeting cookies from web browsers on the local system.
T1539,There are also open source frameworks such as Evilginx 2 and Muraena that can gather session cookies through a malicious proxy  that can be set up by an adversary and used in phishing campaigns.
T1539,"After an adversary acquires a valid cookie, they can then perform a Web Session Cookie technique to login to the corresponding web application."
T1539,"TajMahal has the ability to steal web session cookies from Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, FireFox and RealNetworks applications."
T1539,CookieMiner can steal Google Chrome and Apple Safari browser cookies from the victim’s machine.

T1539,XCSSET uses scp to access the ~/Library/Cookies/Cookies.binarycookies file.
T1539,Evilnum can steal cookies and session information from browsers.
T1558,Adversaries may attempt to subvert Kerberos authentication by stealing or forging Kerberos tickets to enable Pass the Ticket.
T1558,Kerberos is an authentication protocol widely used in modern Windows domain environments.
T1558,"In Kerberos environments, referred to as “realms”, there are three basic participants: client, service, and Key Distribution Center ."
T1558,"Clients request access to a service and through the exchange of Kerberos tickets, originating from KDC, they are granted access after having successfully authenticated."
T1558,The KDC is responsible for both authentication and ticket granting.
T1558,Attackers may attempt to abuse Kerberos by stealing tickets or forging tickets to enable unauthorized access.
T1558,"On Windows, the built-in klist utility can be used to list and analyze cached Kerberos tickets."
T1558,"Linux systems on Active Directory domains store Kerberos credentials locally in the credential cache file referred to as the ""ccache""."
T1558,The credentials are stored in the ccache file while they remain valid and generally while a user's session lasts.
T1558,"On modern Redhat Enterprise Linux systems, and derivative distributions, the System Security Services Daemon  handles Kerberos tickets."
T1558,By default SSSD maintains a copy of the ticket database that can be found in /var/lib/sss/secrets/secrets.ldb as well as the corresponding key located in /var/lib/sss/secrets/.secrets.mkey.
T1558,Both files require root access to read.
T1558,"If an adversary is able to access the database and key, the credential cache Kerberos blob can be extracted and converted into a usable Kerberos ccache file that adversaries may use for Pass the Ticket."
T1558,The ccache file may also be converted into a Windows format using tools such as Kekeo.
T1558,"Kerberos tickets on macOS are stored in a standard ccache format, similar to Linux."
T1558,"By default, access to these ccache entries is federated through the KCM daemon process via the Mach RPC protocol, which uses the caller's environment to determine access."
T1558,The storage location for these ccache entries is influenced by the /etc/krb5.conf configuration file and the KRB5CCNAME environment variable which can specify to save them to disk or keep them protected via the KCM daemon.
T1558,"Users can interact with ticket storage using kinit, klist, ktutil, and kcc built-in binaries or via Apple's native Kerberos framework."
T1558,Adversaries can use open source tools to interact with the ccache files directly or to use the Kerberos framework to call lower-level APIs for extracting the user's TGT or Service Tickets.
T1027,Adversaries may use steganography techniques in order to prevent the detection of hidden information.
T1027,"Steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital media such as images, audio tracks, video clips, or text files."
T1027,Duqu was an early example of malware that used steganography.
T1027,It encrypted the gathered information from a victim's system and hid it within an image before exfiltrating the image to a C2 server.
T1027,"By the end of 2017, a threat group used Invoke-PSImage to hide PowerShell commands in an image file  and execute the code on a victim's system."
T1027,In this particular case the PowerShell code downloaded another obfuscated script to gather intelligence from the victim's machine and communicate it back to the adversary.
T1027,"Okrum's payload is encrypted and embedded within its loader, or within a legitimate PNG file."

T1027,Andariel has hidden malicious executables within PNG files.
T1001,Adversaries may use steganographic techniques to hide command and control traffic to make detection efforts more difficult.
T1001,Steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital messages that are transferred between systems.
T1001,This hidden information can be used for command and control of compromised systems.
T1001,"In some cases, the passing of files embedded using steganography, such as image or document files, can be used for command and control."
T1001,Daserf can use steganography to hide malicious code downloaded to the victim.
T1001,HAMMERTOSS is controlled via commands that are appended to image files.
T1001,"When the Duqu command and control is operating over HTTP or HTTPS, Duqu uploads data to its controller by appending it to a blank JPG file."
T1001,ZeroT has retrieved stage 2 payloads as Bitmap images that use Least Significant Bit  steganography.
T1001,LightNeuron is controlled via commands that are embedded into PDFs and JPGs using steganographic methods.
T1001,RDAT can process steganographic images attached to email messages to send and receive C2 commands.
T1001,RDAT can also embed additional messages within BMP images to communicate with the RDAT operator.
T1001,SUNBURST C2 data attempted to appear as benign XML related to .NET assemblies or as a faux JSON blob.
T1001,Some malware that has been used by Axiom also uses steganography to hide communication in PNG image files.
T1001,APT29 has used steganography to hide C2 communications in images.
T1565,"Adversaries may insert, delete, or manipulate data at rest in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity."
T1565,"By manipulating stored data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making."
T1565,"Stored data could include a variety of file formats, such as Office files, databases, stored emails, and custom file formats."
T1565,The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the type of data as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary.
T1565,"SUNSPOT created a copy of the SolarWinds Orion software source file with a .bk extension to backup the original content, wrote SUNBURST using the same filename but with a .tmp extension, and then moved SUNBURST using MoveFileEx to the original filename with a .cs extension so it could be compiled within Orion software."
T1565,"APT38 has used DYEPACK to create, delete, and alter records in databases used for SWIFT transactions."
T1553,Adversaries may undermine security controls that will either warn users of untrusted activity or prevent execution of untrusted programs.
T1553,Operating systems and security products may contain mechanisms to identify programs or websites as possessing some level of trust.
T1553,"Examples of such features would include a program being allowed to run because it is signed by a valid code signing certificate, a program prompting the user with a warning because it has an attribute set from being downloaded from the Internet, or getting an indication that you are about to connect to an untrusted site."
T1553,Adversaries may attempt to subvert these trust mechanisms.
T1553,The method adversaries use will depend on the specific mechanism they seek to subvert.
T1553,Adversaries may conduct File and Directory Permissions Modification or Modify Registry in support of subverting these controls.
T1553,Adversaries may also create or steal code signing certificates to acquire trust on target systems.
T1548,Adversaries may perform sudo caching and/or use the suoders file to elevate privileges.
T1548,Adversaries may do this to execute commands as other users or spawn processes with higher privileges.
T1548,"Within Linux and MacOS systems, sudo  allows users to perform commands from terminals with elevated privileges and to control who can perform these commands on the system."
T1548,"The sudo command ""allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users  the ability to run some  commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments."""
T1548,"Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration features such as a timestamp_timeout, which is the amount of time in minutes between instances of sudo before it will re-prompt for a password."
T1548,This is because sudo has the ability to cache credentials for a period of time.
T1548,Sudo creates  a file at /var/db/sudo with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout.
T1548,"Additionally, there is a tty_tickets variable that treats each new tty  in isolation."
T1548,"This means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one tty will not affect another tty ."
T1548,"The sudoers file, /etc/sudoers, describes which users can run which commands and from which terminals."
T1548,This also describes which commands users can run as other users or groups.
T1548,"This provides the principle of least privilege such that users are running in their lowest possible permissions for most of the time and only elevate to other users or permissions as needed, typically by prompting for a password."
T1548,"However, the sudoers file can also specify when to not prompt users for passwords with a line like user1 ALL= NOPASSWD: ALL ."
T1548,Elevated privileges are required to edit this file though.
T1548,Adversaries can also abuse poor configurations of these mechanisms to escalate privileges without needing the user's password.
T1548,"For example, /var/db/sudo's timestamp can be monitored to see if it falls within the timestamp_timeout range."
T1548,"If it does, then malware can execute sudo commands without needing to supply the user's password."
T1548,"Additional, if tty_tickets is disabled, adversaries can do this from any tty for that user."
T1548,"In the wild, malware has disabled tty_tickets to potentially make scripting easier by issuing echo \'Defaults !tty_tickets\' >> /etc/sudoers ."
T1548,"In order for this change to be reflected, the malware also issued killall Terminal."
T1548,"As of macOS Sierra, the sudoers file has tty_tickets enabled by default."
T1548,Proton modifies the tty_tickets line in the sudoers file.
T1548,Cobalt Strike can use sudo to run a command.
T1548,Dok adds admin  ALL= NOPASSWD: ALL to the /etc/sudoers file.
T1195,Adversaries may manipulate products or product delivery mechanisms prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise.
T1195,"Supply chain compromise can take place at any stage of the supply chain including:
* Manipulation of development tools
* Manipulation of a development environment
* Manipulation of source code repositories 
* Manipulation of source code in open-source dependencies
* Manipulation of software update/distribution mechanisms
* Compromised/infected system images    
* Replacement of legitimate software with modified versions
* Sales of modified/counterfeit products to legitimate distributors
* Shipment interdiction
While supply chain compromise can impact any component of hardware or software, attackers looking to gain execution have often focused on malicious additions to legitimate software in software distribution or update channels."
T1195,Targeting may be specific to a desired victim set  or malicious software may be distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to additional tactics on specific victims.
T1195,Popular open source projects that are used as dependencies in many applications may also be targeted as a means to add malicious code to users of the dependency.
T1195,Smoke Loader was distributed through a compromised update to a Tor client with a coin miner payload.
T1195,"NotPetya's initial infection vector for the June 27, 2017 compromise was a backdoor in the Ukrainian tax accounting software M.E.Doc."
T1195,Elderwood has targeted manufacturers in the supply chain for the defense industry.
T1573,Adversaries may employ a known symmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol.
T1573,Symmetric encryption algorithms use the same key for plaintext encryption and ciphertext decryption.

T1543,Adversaries may create or modify systemd services to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence.
T1543,The systemd service manager is commonly used for managing background daemon processes  and other system resources.
T1543,"Systemd is the default initialization  system on many Linux distributions starting with Debian 8, Ubuntu 15.04, CentOS 7, RHEL 7, Fedora 15, and replaces legacy init systems including SysVinit and Upstart while remaining backwards compatible with the aforementioned init systems."
T1543,Systemd utilizes configuration files known as service units to control how services boot and under what conditions.
T1543,"By default, these unit files are stored in the /etc/systemd/system and /usr/lib/systemd/system directories and have the file extension .service."
T1543,"Each service unit file may contain numerous directives that can execute system commands:
* ExecStart, ExecStartPre, and ExecStartPost directives cover execution of commands when a services is started manually by 'systemctl' or on system start if the service is set to automatically start."
T1543,* ExecReload directive covers when a service restarts.
T1543,* ExecStop and ExecStopPost directives cover when a service is stopped or manually by 'systemctl'.
T1543,Adversaries have used systemd functionality to establish persistent access to victim systems by creating and/or modifying service unit files that cause systemd to execute malicious commands at system boot.
T1543,"While adversaries typically require root privileges to create/modify service unit files in the /etc/systemd/system and /usr/lib/systemd/system directories, low privilege users can create/modify service unit files in directories such as ~/.config/systemd/user/ to achieve user-level persistence."
T1543,Fysbis has established persistence using a systemd service.
T1543,Exaramel for Linux has a hardcoded location under systemd that it uses to achieve persistence if it is running as root.
T1543,Hildegard has started a monero service.
T1543,Rocke has installed a systemd service script to maintain persistence.
T1543,TeamTNT has established persistence through the creation of a cryptocurrency mining system service.
T1053,Adversaries may abuse systemd timers to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code.
T1053,Systemd timers are unit files with file extension .timer that control services.
T1053,Timers can be set to run on a calendar event or after a time span relative to a starting point.
T1053,They can be used as an alternative to Cron in Linux environments.
T1053,"Systemd timers may be activated remotely via the systemctl command line utility, which operates over SSH."
T1053,"Each .timer file must have a corresponding .service file with the same name, e.g., example.timer and example.service."
T1053,.service files are Systemd Service unit files that are managed by the systemd system and service manager.
T1053,Privileged timers are written to /etc/systemd/system/ and /usr/lib/systemd/system while user level are written to ~/.config/systemd/user/.
T1053,An adversary may use systemd timers to execute malicious code at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence.
T1053,Timers installed using privileged paths may be used to maintain root level persistence.
T1053,Adversaries may also install user level timers to achieve user level persistence.
T1542,Adversaries may abuse netbooting to load an unauthorized network device operating system from a Trivial File Transfer Protocol  server.
T1542,TFTP boot  is commonly used by network administrators to load configuration-controlled network device images from a centralized management server.
T1542,"Netbooting is one option in the boot sequence and can be used to centralize, manage, and control device images."
T1542,"Adversaries may manipulate the configuration on the network device specifying use of a malicious TFTP server, which may be used in conjunction with Modify System Image to load a modified image on device startup or reset."
T1542,"The unauthorized image allows adversaries to modify device configuration, add malicious capabilities to the device, and introduce backdoors to maintain control of the network device while minimizing detection through use of a standard functionality."
T1542,This technique is similar to ROMMONkit and may result in the network device running a modified image.
T1080,"Adversaries may deliver payloads to remote systems by adding content to shared storage locations, such as network drives or internal code repositories."
T1080,"Content stored on network drives or in other shared locations may be tainted by adding malicious programs, scripts, or exploit code to otherwise valid files."
T1080,"Once a user opens the shared tainted content, the malicious portion can be executed to run the adversary's code on a remote system."
T1080,Adversaries may use tainted shared content to move laterally.
T1080,A directory share pivot is a variation on this technique that uses several other techniques to propagate malware when users access a shared network directory.
T1080,"It uses Shortcut Modification of directory .LNK files that use Masquerading to look like the real directories, which are hidden through Hidden Files and Directories."
T1080,The malicious .LNK-based directories have an embedded command that executes the hidden malware file in the directory and then opens the real intended directory so that the user's expected action still occurs.
T1080,"When used with frequently used network directories, the technique may result in frequent reinfections and broad access to systems and potentially to new and higher privileged accounts."
T1080,Adversaries may also compromise shared network directories through binary infections by appending or prepending its code to the healthy binary on the shared network directory.
T1080,The malware may modify the original entry point  of the healthy binary to ensure that it is executed before the legitimate code.
T1080,The infection could continue to spread via the newly infected file when it is executed by a remote system.
T1080,"These infections may target both binary and non-binary formats that end with extensions including, but not limited to, .EXE, .DLL, .SCR, .BAT, and/or .VBS."
T1080,Miner-C copies itself into the public folder of Network Attached Storage  devices and infects new victims who open the file.

T1080,Gamaredon Group has injected malicious macros into all Word and Excel documents on mapped network drives.
T1221,Adversaries may create or modify references in Office document templates to conceal malicious code or force authentication attempts.
T1221,Microsoft’s Office Open XML  specification defines an XML-based format for Office documents  to replace older binary formats .
T1221,"OOXML files are packed together ZIP archives compromised of various XML files, referred to as parts, containing properties that collectively define how a document is rendered."
T1221,Properties within parts may reference shared public resources accessed via online URLs.
T1221,"For example, template properties reference a file, serving as a pre-formatted document blueprint, that is fetched when the document is loaded."
T1221,Adversaries may abuse this technology to initially conceal malicious code to be executed via documents.
T1221,Template references injected into a document may enable malicious payloads to be fetched and executed when the document is loaded.
T1221,These documents can be delivered via other techniques such as Phishing and/or Taint Shared Content and may evade static detections since no typical indicators  are present until after the malicious payload is fetched.
T1221,Examples have been seen in the wild where template injection was used to load malicious code containing an exploit.
T1221,This technique may also enable Forced Authentication by injecting a SMB/HTTPS  URL and triggering an authentication attempt.
T1221,Chaes changed the template target of the settings.xml file embedded in the Word document and populated that field with the downloaded URL of the next payload.
T1221,Dragonfly 2.0 has injected SMB URLs into malicious Word spearphishing attachments to initiate Forced Authentication.
T1221,"DarkHydrus used an open-source tool, Phishery, to inject malicious remote template URLs into Microsoft Word documents and then sent them to victims to enable Forced Authentication."
T1221,"Tropic Trooper delivered malicious documents with the XLSX extension, typically used by OpenXML documents, but the file itself was actually an OLE  document."
T1221,APT28 used weaponized Microsoft Word documents abusing the remote template function to retrieve a malicious macro.
T1221,Inception has used decoy documents to load malicious remote payloads via HTTP.
T1221,Frankenstein has used trojanized documents that retrieve remote templates from an adversary-controlled website.
T1221,Gamaredon Group has used DOCX files to download malicious DOT document templates.
T1221,Gamaredon Group can also inject malicious macros or remote templates into documents already present on compromised systems.
T1055,Adversaries may inject malicious code into hijacked processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
T1055,Thread Execution Hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
T1055,"Thread Execution Hijacking is commonly performed by suspending an existing process then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code or the path to a DLL."
T1055,"At this point the process can be suspended then written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via SuspendThread , VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, SetThreadContext, then ResumeThread respectively."
T1055,This is very similar to Process Hollowing but targets an existing process rather than creating a process in a suspended state.
T1055,Execution via Thread Execution Hijacking may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
T1055,Gazer performs thread execution hijacking to inject its orchestrator into a running thread from a remote process.
T1055,Trojan.Karagany can inject a suspended thread of its own process into a new process and initiate via the ResumeThread API.
T1055,Waterbear can use thread injection to inject shellcode into the process of security software.
T1055,Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via thread local storage  callbacks in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
T1055,TLS callback injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
T1055,TLS callback injection involves manipulating pointers inside a portable executable  to redirect a process to malicious code before reaching the code's legitimate entry point.
T1055,TLS callbacks are normally used by the OS to setup and/or cleanup data used by threads.
T1055,Manipulating TLS callbacks may be performed by allocating and writing to specific offsets within a process’ memory space using other Process Injection techniques such as Process Hollowing.
T1055,Execution via TLS callback injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
T1055,Ursnif has injected code into target processes via thread local storage callbacks.
T1597,Adversaries may search private data from threat intelligence vendors for information that can be used during targeting.
T1597,Threat intelligence vendors may offer paid feeds or portals that offer more data than what is publicly reported.
T1597,"Although sensitive details  may be redacted, this information may contain trends regarding breaches such as target industries, attribution claims, and successful TTPs/countermeasures."
T1597,Adversaries may search in private threat intelligence vendor data to gather actionable information.
T1597,"Threat actors may seek information/indicators gathered about their own campaigns, as well as those conducted by other adversaries that may align with their target industries, capabilities/objectives, or other operational concerns."
T1597,"Information reported by vendors may also reveal opportunities other forms of reconnaissance , establishing operational resources  or Obtain Capabilities, and/or initial access  or External Remote Services."
T1497,Adversaries may employ various time-based methods to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments.
T1497,"This may include enumerating time-based properties, such as uptime or the system clock, as well as the use of timers or other triggers to avoid a virtual machine environment  or sandbox, specifically those that are automated or only operate for a limited amount of time."
T1497,"Adversaries may employ various time-based evasions, such as delaying malware functionality upon initial execution using programmatic sleep commands or native system scheduling functionality ."
T1497,Delays may also be based on waiting for specific victim conditions to be met  or employ scheduled Multi-Stage Channels to avoid analysis and scrutiny.
T1497,Benign commands or other operations may also be used to delay malware execution.
T1497,"Loops or otherwise needless repetitions of commands, such as Pings, may be used to delay malware execution and potentially exceed time thresholds of automated analysis environments."
T1497,"Another variation, commonly referred to as API hammering, involves making various calls to Native API functions in order to delay execution ."
T1497,"Adversaries may also use time as a metric to detect sandboxes and analysis environments, particularly those that attempt to manipulate time mechanisms to simulate longer elapses of time."
T1497,"For example, an adversary may be able to identify a sandbox accelerating time by sampling and calculating the expected value for an environment's timestamp before and after execution of a sleep function."

T1547,Adversaries may abuse time providers to execute DLLs when the system boots.
T1547,The Windows Time service  enables time synchronization across and within domains.
T1547,W32Time time providers are responsible for retrieving time stamps from hardware/network resources and outputting these values to other network clients.
T1547,Time providers are implemented as dynamic-link libraries  that are registered in the subkeys of  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\.
T1547,"The time provider manager, directed by the service control manager, loads and starts time providers listed and enabled under this key at system startup and/or whenever parameters are changed."

T1020,Adversaries may leverage traffic mirroring in order to automate data exfiltration over compromised network infrastructure.
T1020,Traffic mirroring is a native feature for some network devices and used for network analysis and may be configured to duplicate traffic and forward to one or more destinations for analysis by a network analyzer or other monitoring device.
T1020,Adversaries may abuse traffic mirroring to mirror or redirect network traffic through other network infrastructure they control.
T1020,Malicious modifications to network devices to enable traffic redirection may be possible through ROMMONkit or Patch System Image.
T1020,"Adversaries may use traffic duplication in conjunction with Network Sniffing, Input Capture, or Adversary-in-the-Middle depending on the goals and objectives of the adversary."
T1205,Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control.
T1205,"Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task."
T1205,This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control.
T1205,"Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports  Port Knocking, but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics."
T1205,"After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software."
T1205,"Adversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious functionality if passed the appropriate magic value."
T1205,"On network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enable Network Device Authentication for standard services offered by the device such as telnet."
T1205,"Such signaling may also be used to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modification of malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities."
T1205,"To enable this traffic signaling on embedded devices, adversaries must first achieve and leverage Patch System Image due to the monolithic nature of the architecture."
T1205,Adversaries may also use the Wake-on-LAN feature to turn on powered off systems.
T1205,"Wake-on-LAN is a hardware feature that allows a powered down system to be powered on, or woken up, by sending a magic packet to it."
T1205,"Once the system is powered on, it may become a target for lateral movement."
T1205,"Chaos provides a reverse shell is triggered upon receipt of a packet with a special string, sent to any port."
T1205,"Umbreon provides additional access using its backdoor Espeon, providing a reverse shell upon receipt of a special packet."
T1205,"Winnti for Linux has used a passive listener, capable of identifying a specific magic value before executing tasking, as a secondary command and control  mechanism."

T1205,"Penquin will connect to C2 only after sniffing a ""magic packet"" value in TCP or UDP packets matching specific conditions."
T1205,Kobalos is triggered by an incoming TCP connection to a legitimate service from a specific source port.
T1205,"Umbreon provides additional access using its backdoor Espeon, providing a reverse shell upon receipt of a special packet"
T1537,"Adversaries may exfiltrate data by transferring the data, including backups of cloud environments, to another cloud account they control on the same service to avoid typical file transfers/downloads and network-based exfiltration detection."
T1537,A defender who is monitoring for large transfers to outside the cloud environment through normal file transfers or over command and control channels may not be watching for data transfers to another account within the same cloud provider.
T1537,Such transfers may utilize existing cloud provider APIs and the internal address space of the cloud provider to blend into normal traffic or avoid data transfers over external network interfaces.
T1537,Incidents have been observed where adversaries have created backups of cloud instances and transferred them to separate accounts.
T1565,Adversaries may alter data en route to storage or other systems in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity.
T1565,"By manipulating transmitted data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making."
T1565,Manipulation may be possible over a network connection or between system processes where there is an opportunity deploy a tool that will intercept and change information.
T1565,The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target transmission mechanism as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary.
T1565,"LightNeuron is capable of modifying email content, headers, and attachments during transit."
T1565,"Metamorfo has a function that can watch the contents of the system clipboard for valid bitcoin addresses, which it then overwrites with the attacker's address."
T1565,Melcoz can monitor the clipboard for cryptocurrency addresses and change the intended address to one controlled by the adversary.
T1565,APT38 has used DYEPACK to manipulate SWIFT messages en route to a printer.
T1505,Adversaries may abuse Microsoft transport agents to establish persistent access to systems.
T1505,"Microsoft Exchange transport agents can operate on email messages passing through the transport pipeline to perform various tasks such as filtering spam, filtering malicious attachments, journaling, or adding a corporate signature to the end of all outgoing emails."
T1505,Transport agents can be written by application developers and then compiled to .NET assemblies that are subsequently registered with the Exchange server.
T1505,Transport agents will be invoked during a specified stage of email processing and carry out developer defined tasks.
T1505,Adversaries may register a malicious transport agent to provide a persistence mechanism in Exchange Server that can be triggered by adversary-specified email events.
T1505,"Though a malicious transport agent may be invoked for all emails passing through the Exchange transport pipeline, the agent can be configured to only carry out specific tasks in response to adversary defined criteria."
T1505,"For example, the transport agent may only carry out an action like copying in-transit attachments and saving them for later exfiltration if the recipient email address matches an entry on a list provided by the adversary."
T1505,LightNeuron has used a malicious Microsoft Exchange transport agent for persistence.
T1546,Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by an interrupt signal.
T1546,The trap command allows programs and shells to specify commands that will be executed upon receiving interrupt signals.
T1546,A common situation is a script allowing for graceful termination and handling of common keyboard interrupts like ctrl+c and ctrl+d.
T1546,Adversaries can use this to register code to be executed when the shell encounters specific interrupts as a persistence mechanism.
T1546,"Trap commands are of the following format trap 'command list' signals where ""command list"" will be executed when ""signals"" are received."
T1127,Adversaries may take advantage of trusted developer utilities to proxy execution of malicious payloads.
T1127,"There are many utilities used for software development related tasks that can be used to execute code in various forms to assist in development, debugging, and reverse engineering."
T1127,These utilities may often be signed with legitimate certificates that allow them to execute on a system and proxy execution of malicious code through a trusted process that effectively bypasses application control solutions.
T1127,"A version of PlugX loads as shellcode within a .NET Framework project using msbuild.exe, presumably to bypass application whitelisting techniques."
T1199,Adversaries may breach or otherwise leverage organizations who have access to intended victims.
T1199,Access through trusted third party relationship exploits an existing connection that may not be protected or receives less scrutiny than standard mechanisms of gaining access to a network.
T1199,Organizations often grant elevated access to second or third-party external providers in order to allow them to manage internal systems as well as cloud-based environments.
T1199,"Some examples of these relationships include IT services contractors, managed security providers, infrastructure contractors ."
T1199,"The third-party provider's access may be intended to be limited to the infrastructure being maintained, but may exist on the same network as the rest of the enterprise."
T1199,"As such, Valid Accounts used by the other party for access to internal network systems may be compromised and used."
T1199,menuPass has used legitimate access granted to Managed Service Providers in order to access victims of interest.
T1199,"Once APT28 gained access to the DCCC network, the group then proceeded to use that access to compromise the DNC network."
T1199,GOLD SOUTHFIELD has breached Managed Service Providers  to deliver malware to MSP customers.
T1199,Sandworm Team has used dedicated network connections from one victim organization to gain unauthorized access to a separate organization.
T1199,APT29 has used compromised certificates issued by Mimecast to authenticate to Mimecast customer systems.
T1111,"Adversaries may target two-factor authentication mechanisms, such as smart cards, to gain access to credentials that can be used to access systems, services, and network resources."
T1111,"Use of two or multi-factor authentication  is recommended and provides a higher level of security than user names and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms."
T1111,"If a smart card is used for two-factor authentication, then a keylogger will need to be used to obtain the password associated with a smart card during normal use."
T1111,"With both an inserted card and access to the smart card password, an adversary can connect to a network resource using the infected system to proxy the authentication with the inserted hardware token."
T1111,"Adversaries may also employ a keylogger to similarly target other hardware tokens, such as RSA SecurID."
T1111,Capturing token input  may provide temporary access  replay the one-time passcode until the next value rollover as well as possibly enabling adversaries to reliably predict future authentication values .
T1111,Other methods of 2FA may be intercepted and used by an adversary to authenticate.
T1111,It is common for one-time codes to be sent via out-of-band communications .
T1111,"If the device and/or service is not secured, then it may be vulnerable to interception."
T1111,"Although primarily focused on by cyber criminals, these authentication mechanisms have been targeted by advanced actors."
T1111,Sykipot is known to contain functionality that enables targeting of smart card technologies to proxy authentication for connections to restricted network resources using detected hardware tokens.
T1111,Operation Wocao has used a custom collection method to intercept two-factor authentication soft tokens.
T1111,Chimera has registered alternate phone numbers for compromised users to intercept 2FA codes sent via SMS.
T1059,Adversaries may abuse Unix shell commands and scripts for execution.
T1059,"Unix shells are the primary command prompt on Linux and macOS systems, though many variations of the Unix shell exist  depending on the specific OS or distribution."
T1059,"Unix shells can control every aspect of a system, with certain commands requiring elevated privileges."
T1059,Unix shells also support scripts that enable sequential execution of commands as well as other typical programming operations such as conditionals and loops.
T1059,"Common uses of shell scripts include long or repetitive tasks, or the need to run the same set of commands on multiple systems."
T1059,Adversaries may abuse Unix shells to execute various commands or payloads.
T1059,Interactive shells may be accessed through command and control channels or during lateral movement such as with SSH.
T1059,Adversaries may also leverage shell scripts to deliver and execute multiple commands on victims or as part of payloads used for persistence.
T1059,CallMe has the capability to create a reverse shell on victims.
T1059,Derusbi is capable of creating a remote Bash shell and executing commands.

T1059,APT41 executed file /bin/pwd in activity exploiting CVE-2019-19781 against Citrix devices.
T1059,Rocke used shell scripts to run commands which would obtain persistence and execute the cryptocurrency mining malware.
T1059,TeamTNT has used shell scripts for execution.
T1546,Adversaries may establish persistence through executing malicious commands triggered by a user’s shell.
T1546,User Unix Shells execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session based on events.
T1546,"For example, when a user opens a command-line interface or remotely logs in  a login shell is initiated."
T1546,The login shell executes scripts from the system  and the user’s home directory  to configure the environment.
T1546,All login shells on a system use /etc/profile when initiated.
T1546,"These configuration scripts run at the permission level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables, create aliases, and customize the user’s environment."
T1546,"When the shell exits or terminates, additional shell scripts are executed to ensure the shell exits appropriately."
T1546,Adversaries may attempt to establish persistence by inserting commands into scripts automatically executed by shells.
T1546,"Using bash as an example, the default shell for most GNU/Linux systems, adversaries may add commands that launch malicious binaries into the /etc/profile and /etc/profile.d files."
T1546,These files typically require root permissions to modify and are executed each time any shell on a system launches.
T1546,"For user level permissions, adversaries can insert malicious commands into ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, or ~/.profile which are sourced when a user opens a command-line interface or connects remotely."
T1546,"Since the system only executes the first existing file in the listed order, adversaries have used ~/.bash_profile to ensure execution."
T1546,"Adversaries have also leveraged the ~/.bashrc file which is additionally executed if the connection is established remotely or an additional interactive shell is opened, such as a new tab in the command-line interface."
T1546,"Some malware targets the termination of a program to trigger execution, adversaries can use the ~/.bash_logout file to execute malicious commands at the end of a session."
T1546,"For macOS, the functionality of this technique is similar but may leverage zsh, the default shell for macOS 10.15+."
T1546,"When the Terminal.app is opened, the application launches a zsh login shell and a zsh interactive shell."
T1546,"The login shell configures the system environment using /etc/profile, /etc/zshenv, /etc/zprofile, and /etc/zlogin."
T1546,The login shell then configures the user environment with ~/.zprofile and ~/.zlogin.
T1546,The interactive shell uses the ~/.zshrc to configure the user environment.
T1546,"Upon exiting, /etc/zlogout and ~/.zlogout are executed."
T1546,"For legacy programs, macOS executes /etc/bashrc on startup."
T1546,Linux Rabbit maintains persistence on an infected machine through rc.local and .bashrc files.
T1552,Adversaries may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials.
T1552,"These credentials can be stored and/or misplaced in many locations on a system, including plaintext files , operating system or application-specific repositories , or other specialized files/artifacts ."
T1535,Adversaries may create cloud instances in unused geographic service regions in order to evade detection.
T1535,Access is usually obtained through compromising accounts used to manage cloud infrastructure.
T1535,"Cloud service providers often provide infrastructure throughout the world in order to improve performance, provide redundancy, and allow customers to meet compliance requirements."
T1535,"Oftentimes, a customer will only use a subset of the available regions and may not actively monitor other regions."
T1535,"If an adversary creates resources in an unused region, they may be able to operate undetected."
T1535,A variation on this behavior takes advantage of differences in functionality across cloud regions.
T1535,An adversary could utilize regions which do not support advanced detection services in order to avoid detection of their activity.
T1535,"An example of adversary use of unused AWS regions is to mine cryptocurrency through Resource Hijacking, which can cost organizations substantial amounts of money over time depending on the processing power used."
T1608,Adversaries may upload malware to third-party or adversary controlled infrastructure to make it accessible during targeting.
T1608,"Malicious software can include payloads, droppers, post-compromise tools, backdoors, and a variety of other malicious content."
T1608,"Adversaries may upload malware to support their operations, such as making a payload available to a victim network to enable Ingress Tool Transfer by placing it on an Internet accessible web server."
T1608,Malware may be placed on infrastructure that was previously purchased/rented by the adversary  or was otherwise compromised by them .
T1608,"Malware can also be staged on web services, such as GitHub or Pastebin."
T1608,"Adversaries may upload backdoored files, such as application binaries, virtual machine images, or container images, to third-party software stores or repositories ."
T1608,"By chance encounter, victims may directly download/install these backdoored files via User Execution."
T1608,Masquerading may increase the chance of users mistakenly executing these files.
T1608,"APT32 has hosted malicious payloads in Dropbox, Amazon S3, and Google Drive for use during targeting."
T1608,TeamTNT has uploaded backdoored Docker images to Docker Hub.
T1608,Adversaries may upload tools to third-party or adversary controlled infrastructure to make it accessible during targeting.
T1608,"Tools can be used for malicious purposes by an adversary, but  were not intended to be used for those purposes ."
T1608,"Adversaries may upload tools to support their operations, such as making a tool available to a victim network to enable Ingress Tool Transfer by placing it on an Internet accessible web server."
T1608,Tools may be placed on infrastructure that was previously purchased/rented by the adversary  or was otherwise compromised by them .
T1608,"Tools can also be staged on web services, such as an adversary controlled GitHub repo."
T1608,"Adversaries can avoid the need to upload a tool by having compromised victim machines download the tool directly from a third-party hosting location , including the original hosting site of the tool."
T1608,"Threat Group-3390 has staged tools, including gsecdump and WCE, on previously compromised websites."
T1550,"Adversaries may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls."
T1550,Authentication processes generally require a valid identity  along with one or more authentication factors .
T1550,Alternate authentication material is legitimately generated by systems after a user or application successfully authenticates by providing a valid identity and the required authentication factor.
T1550,Alternate authentication material may also be generated during the identity creation process.
T1550,Caching alternate authentication material allows the system to verify an identity has successfully authenticated without asking the user to reenter authentication factor.
T1550,Because the alternate authentication must be maintained by the system—either in memory or on disk—it may be at risk of being stolen through Credential Access techniques.
T1550,"By stealing alternate authentication material, adversaries are able to bypass system access controls and authenticate to systems without knowing the plaintext password or any additional authentication factors."

T1497,Adversaries may employ various user activity checks to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments.
T1497,"Adversaries may search for user activity on the host based on variables such as the speed/frequency of mouse movements and clicks  , browser history, cache, bookmarks, or number of files in common directories such as home or the desktop."
T1497,"Other methods may rely on specific user interaction with the system before the malicious code is activated, such as waiting for a document to close before activating a macro  or waiting for a user to double click on an embedded image to activate."
T1497,"Okrum loader only executes the payload after the left mouse button has been pressed at least three times, in order to avoid being executed within virtualized or emulated environments."
T1497,Spark has used a splash screen to check whether an user actively clicks on the screen before running malicious code.
T1497,FIN7 used images embedded into document lures that only activate the payload when a user double clicks to avoid sandboxes.
T1497,Darkhotel has used malware that repeatedly checks the mouse cursor position to determine if a real user is on the system.
T1204,An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution.
T1204,"Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious code by, for example, opening a malicious document file or link."
T1204,These user actions will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from forms of Phishing.
T1204,"While User Execution frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it."
T1204,Magic Hound has attempted to get users to execute malware via social media and spearphishing emails.
T1564,Adversaries may hide malicious Visual Basic for Applications  payloads embedded within MS Office documents by replacing the VBA source code with benign data.
T1564,MS Office documents with embedded VBA content store source code inside of module streams.
T1564,Each module stream has a PerformanceCache that stores a separate compiled version of the VBA source code known as p-code.
T1564,The p-code is executed when the MS Office version specified in the _VBA_PROJECT stream  matches the version of the host MS Office application.
T1564,"An adversary may hide malicious VBA code by overwriting the VBA source code location with zero’s, benign code, or random bytes while leaving the previously compiled malicious p-code."
T1564,Tools that scan for malicious VBA source code may be bypassed as the unwanted code is hidden in the compiled p-code.
T1564,"If the VBA source code is removed, some tools might even think that there are no macros present."
T1564,"If there is a version match between the _VBA_PROJECT stream and host MS Office application, the p-code will be executed, otherwise the benign VBA source code will be decompressed and recompiled to p-code, thus removing malicious p-code and potentially bypassing dynamic analysis."
T1055,Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via VDSO hijacking in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
T1055,Virtual dynamic shared object  hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
T1055,VDSO hijacking involves redirecting calls to dynamically linked shared libraries.
T1055,Memory protections may prevent writing executable code to a process via Ptrace System Calls.
T1055,"However, an adversary may hijack the syscall interface code stubs mapped into a process from the vdso shared object to execute syscalls to open and map a malicious shared object."
T1055,This code can then be invoked by redirecting the execution flow of the process via patched memory address references stored in a process' global offset table .
T1055,Execution via VDSO hijacking may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
T1021,Adversaries may use Valid Accounts to remotely control machines using Virtual Network Computing .
T1021,"VNC is a platform-independent desktop sharing system that uses the RFB  protocol to enable users to remotely control another computer’s display by relaying the screen, mouse, and keyboard inputs over the network."
T1021,VNC differs from Remote Desktop Protocol as VNC is screen-sharing software rather than resource-sharing software.
T1021,"By default, VNC uses the system's authentication, but it can be configured to use credentials specific to VNC."
T1021,"Adversaries may abuse VNC to perform malicious actions as the logged-on user such as opening documents, downloading files, and running arbitrary commands."
T1021,An adversary could use VNC to remotely control and monitor a system to collect data and information to pivot to other systems within the network.
