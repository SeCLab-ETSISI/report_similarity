T1546,Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by the execution of tainted binaries.
T1546,Mach-O binaries have a series of headers that are used to perform certain operations when a binary is loaded.
T1546,The LC_LOAD_DYLIB header in a Mach-O binary tells macOS and OS X which dynamic libraries  to load during execution time.
T1546,These can be added ad-hoc to the compiled binary as long as adjustments are made to the rest of the fields and dependencies.
T1546,There are tools available to perform these changes.
T1546,Adversaries may modify Mach-O binary headers to load and execute malicious dylibs every time the binary is executed.
T1546,"Although any changes will invalidate digital signatures on binaries because the binary is being modified, this can be remediated by simply removing the LC_CODE_SIGNATURE command from the binary so that the signature isn’t checked at load time."
T1557,"By responding to LLMNR/NBT-NS network traffic, adversaries may spoof an authoritative source for name resolution to force communication with an adversary controlled system."
T1557,This activity may be used to collect or relay authentication materials.
T1557,Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution  and NetBIOS Name Service  are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification.
T1557,LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System  format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts.
T1557,NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name.
T1557,"Adversaries can spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on a victim network by responding to LLMNR /NBT-NS  traffic as if they know the identity of the requested host, effectively poisoning the service so that the victims will communicate with the adversary controlled system."
T1557,"If the requested host belongs to a resource that requires identification/authentication, the username and NTLMv2 hash will then be sent to the adversary controlled system."
T1557,The adversary can then collect the hash information sent over the wire through tools that monitor the ports for traffic or through Network Sniffing and crack the hashes offline through Brute Force to obtain the plaintext passwords.
T1557,"In some cases where an adversary has access to a system that is in the authentication path between systems or when automated scans that use credentials attempt to authenticate to an adversary controlled system, the NTLMv2 hashes can be intercepted and relayed to access and execute code against a target system."
T1557,The relay step can happen in conjunction with poisoning but may also be independent of it.
T1557,"Several tools exist that can be used to poison name services within local networks such as NBNSpoof, Metasploit, and Responder."
T1557,"Wizard Spider has used the Invoke-Inveigh PowerShell cmdlets, likely for name service poisoning."

T1547,Adversaries may modify or add LSASS drivers to obtain persistence on compromised systems.
T1547,The Windows security subsystem is a set of components that manage and enforce the security policy for a computer or domain.
T1547,The Local Security Authority  is the main component responsible for local security policy and user authentication.
T1547,"The LSA includes multiple dynamic link libraries  associated with various other security functions, all of which run in the context of the LSA Subsystem Service  lsass.exe process."
T1547,Adversaries may target LSASS drivers to obtain persistence.
T1547,"By either replacing or adding illegitimate drivers , an adversary can use LSA operations to continuously execute malicious payloads."
T1547,"Wingbird drops a malicious file  alongside a copy of lsass.exe, which is used to register a service that loads sspisrv.dll as a driver."
T1547,The payload of the malicious driver  is executed when loaded by lsass.exe before the spoofed service becomes unstable and crashes.
T1547,Pasam establishes by infecting the Security Accounts Manager  DLL to load a malicious DLL dropped to disk.
T1003,Adversaries may attempt to access credential material stored in the process memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service .
T1003,"After a user logs on, the system generates and stores a variety of credential materials in LSASS process memory."
T1003,These credential materials can be harvested by an administrative user or SYSTEM and used to conduct Lateral Movement using Use Alternate Authentication Material.
T1003,"As well as in-memory techniques, the LSASS process memory can be dumped from the target host and analyzed on a local system."
T1003,"For example, on the target host use procdump:
* procdump -ma lsass.exe lsass_dump
Locally, mimikatz can be run using:
* sekurlsa::Minidump lsassdump.dmp
* sekurlsa::logonPasswords
Built-in Windows tools such as comsvcs.dll can also be used:
* rundll32.exe C:\Windows\System32\comsvcs.dll MiniDump PID  lsass.dmp full
Windows Security Support Provider  DLLs are loaded into LSSAS process at system start."
T1003,"Once loaded into the LSA, SSP DLLs have access to encrypted and plaintext passwords that are stored in Windows, such as any logged-on user's Domain password or smart card PINs."
T1003,The SSP configuration is stored in two Registry keys: HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Security Packages and HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig\Security Packages.
T1003,"An adversary may modify these Registry keys to add new SSPs, which will be loaded the next time the system boots, or when the AddSecurityPackage Windows API function is called."
T1003,"The following SSPs can be used to access credentials:
* Msv: Interactive logons, batch logons, and service logons are done through the MSV authentication package."
T1003,* Wdigest: The Digest Authentication protocol is designed for use with Hypertext Transfer Protocol  and Simple Authentication Security Layer  exchanges.

T1547,"Login items are applications, documents, folders, or server connections that are automatically launched when a user logs in."
T1547,Login items can be added via a shared file list or Service Management Framework.
T1547,"Shared file list login items can be set using scripting languages such as AppleScript, whereas the Service Management Framework uses the API call SMLoginItemSetEnabled."
T1547,"Login items installed using the Service Management Framework leverage launchd, are not visible in the System Preferences, and can only be removed by the application that created them."
T1547,"Login items created using a shared file list are visible in System Preferences, can hide the application when it launches, and are executed through LaunchServices, not launchd, to open applications, documents, or URLs without using Finder."
T1547,"Users and applications use login items to configure their user environment to launch commonly used services or applications, such as email, chat, and music applications."
T1547,Adversaries can utilize AppleScript and Native API calls to create a login item to spawn malicious executables.
T1547,"Prior to version 10.5 on macOS, adversaries can add login items by using AppleScript to send an Apple events to the “System Events” process, which has an AppleScript dictionary for manipulating login items."
T1547,Adversaries can use a command such as tell application “System Events” to make login item at end with properties /path/to/executable.
T1547,This command adds the path of the malicious executable to the login item file list located in ~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.backgroundtaskmanagementagent/backgrounditems.btm.
T1547,Adversaries can also use login items to launch executables that can be used to control the victim system remotely or as a means to gain privilege escalation by prompting for user credentials.
T1547,Dok uses AppleScript to install a login Item by sending Apple events to the System Events process.
T1547,NETWIRE can persist via startup options for Login items.
T1037,Adversaries may use macOS logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence.
T1037,macOS allows logon scripts  to be executed whenever a specific user logs into a system.
T1037,"A login hook tells Mac OS X to execute a certain script when a user logs in, but unlike Startup Items, a login hook executes as the elevated root user."
T1037,Adversaries may use these login hooks to maintain persistence on a single system.
T1037,Access to login hook scripts may allow an adversary to insert additional malicious code.
T1037,"There can only be one login hook at a time though and depending on the access configuration of the hooks, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary."
T1037,Adversaries may use Windows logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence.
T1037,Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system.
T1037,This is done via adding a path to a script to the HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript Registry key.
T1037,JHUHUGIT has registered a Windows shell script under the Registry key HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript to establish persistence.

T1218,Adversaries may abuse mmc.exe to proxy execution of malicious .msc files.
T1218,"Microsoft Management Console, or MMC, is a signed Windows binary and is used in several ways in either its GUI or in a command prompt."
T1218,"MMC can be used to create, open, and save custom consoles that contain administrative tools created by Microsoft, called snap-ins."
T1218,These snap-ins may be used to manage Windows systems locally or remotely.
T1218,MMC can also be used to open Microsoft created .msc files to manage system configuration.
T1218,"For example, mmc C:\Users\foo\admintools.msc /a will open a custom, saved console msc file in author mode."
T1218,"Another common example is mmc gpedit.msc, which will open the Group Policy Editor application window."
T1218,Adversaries may use MMC commands to perform malicious tasks.
T1218,"For example, mmc wbadmin.msc delete catalog -quiet deletes the backup catalog on the system  Inhibit System Recovery without prompts to the user ."
T1218,Adversaries may also abuse MMC to execute malicious .msc files.
T1218,"For example, adversaries may first create a malicious registry Class Identifier  subkey, which uniquely identifies a Component Object Model class object."
T1218,"Then, adversaries may create custom consoles with the “Link to Web Address” snap-in that is linked to the malicious CLSID subkey."
T1218,"Once the .msc file is saved, adversaries may invoke the malicious CLSID payload with the following command: mmc.exe -Embedding C:\path\to\test.msc."
T1127,Adversaries may use MSBuild to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility.
T1127,MSBuild.exe  is a software build platform used by Visual Studio.
T1127,It handles XML formatted project files that define requirements for loading and building various platforms and configurations.
T1127,Adversaries can abuse MSBuild to proxy execution of malicious code.
T1127,The inline task capability of MSBuild that was introduced in .NET version 4 allows for C# or Visual Basic code to be inserted into an XML project file.
T1127,MSBuild will compile and execute the inline task.
T1127,"MSBuild.exe is a signed Microsoft binary, so when it is used this way it can execute arbitrary code and bypass application control defenses that are configured to allow MSBuild.exe execution."
T1127,"A version of PlugX loads as shellcode within a .NET Framework project using msbuild.exe, presumably to bypass application control techniques."
T1127,Frankenstein has used MSbuild to execute an actor-created file.
T1071,Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with electronic mail delivery to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic.
T1071,"Protocols such as SMTP/S, POP3/S, and IMAP that carry electronic mail may be very common in environments."
T1071,Data could also be concealed within the email messages themselves.

T1134,The function will return a copy of the new session's access token and the adversary can use SetThreadToken to assign the token to a thread.
T1134,Cobalt Strike can make tokens from known credentials.
T1204,An adversary may rely upon a user opening a malicious file in order to gain execution.
T1204,Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to open a file that will lead to code execution.
T1204,This user action will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from Spearphishing Attachment.
T1204,"Adversaries may use several types of files that require a user to execute them, including .doc, .pdf, .xls, .rtf, .scr, .exe, .lnk, .pif, and .cpl."
T1204,Adversaries may employ various forms of Masquerading on the file to increase the likelihood that a user will open it.
T1204,"While Malicious File frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it."

T1104,APT41 used the storescyncsvc.dll BEACON backdoor to download a secondary backdoor.
T1090,"To disguise the source of malicious traffic, adversaries may chain together multiple proxies."
T1090,"Typically, a defender will be able to identify the last proxy traffic traversed before it enters their network; the defender may or may not be able to identify any previous proxies before the last-hop proxy."
T1090,This technique makes identifying the original source of the malicious traffic even more difficult by requiring the defender to trace malicious traffic through several proxies to identify its source.
T1090,"A particular variant of this behavior is to use onion routing networks, such as the publicly available TOR network."
T1090,"In the case of network infrastructure, particularly routers, it is possible for an adversary to leverage multiple compromised devices to create a multi-hop proxy chain within the Wide-Area Network  of the enterprise."
T1090,"By leveraging Patch System Image, adversaries can add custom code to the affected network devices that will implement onion routing between those nodes."
T1090,"This custom onion routing network will transport the encrypted C2 traffic through the compromised population, allowing adversaries to communicate with any device within the onion routing network."

T1599,Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by modifying a network device’s Network Address Translation  configuration.
T1599,Malicious modifications to NAT may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.
T1599,Network devices such as routers and firewalls that connect multiple networks together may implement NAT during the process of passing packets between networks.
T1599,"When performing NAT, the network device will rewrite the source and/or destination addresses of the IP address header."
T1599,Some network designs require NAT for the packets to cross the border device.
T1599,A typical example of this is environments where internal networks make use of non-Internet routable addresses.
T1599,"When an adversary gains control of a network boundary device, they can either leverage existing NAT configurations to send traffic between two separated networks, or they can implement NAT configurations of their own design."
T1599,"In the case of network designs that require NAT to function, this enables the adversary to overcome inherent routing limitations that would normally prevent them from accessing protected systems behind the border device."
T1599,"In the case of network designs that do not require NAT, address translation can be used by adversaries to obscure their activities, as changing the addresses of packets that traverse a network boundary device can make monitoring data transmissions more challenging for defenders."

T1599,They achieve this by restricting traffic types to enforce organizational policy in an attempt to reduce the risk inherent in such connections.
T1599,"Restriction of traffic can be achieved by prohibiting IP addresses, layer 4 protocol ports, or through deep packet inspection to identify applications."
T1599,"To participate with the rest of the network, these devices can be directly addressable or transparent, but their mode of operation has no bearing on how the adversary can bypass them when compromised."
T1599,"When an adversary takes control of such a boundary device, they can bypass its policy enforcement to pass normally prohibited traffic across the trust boundary between the two separated networks without hinderance."
T1599,"By achieving sufficient rights on the device, an adversary can reconfigure the device to allow the traffic they want, allowing them to then further achieve goals such as command and control via Multi-hop Proxy or exfiltration of data via Traffic Duplication."

T1059,Adversaries can use the network CLI to change how network devices behave and operate.
T1059,"The CLI may be used to manipulate traffic flows to intercept or manipulate data, modify startup configuration parameters to load malicious system software, or to disable security features or logging to avoid detection."
T1602,Adversaries may access network configuration files to collect sensitive data about the device and the network.
T1602,The network configuration is a file containing parameters that determine the operation of the device.
T1602,"The device typically stores an in-memory copy of the configuration while operating, and a separate configuration on non-volatile storage to load after device reset."
T1602,"Adversaries can inspect the configuration files to reveal information about the target network and its layout, the network device and its software, or identifying legitimate accounts and credentials for later use."
T1602,"Adversaries can use common management tools and protocols, such as Simple Network Management Protocol  and Smart Install , to access network configuration files."
T1602,These tools may be used to query specific data from a configuration repository or configure the device to export the configuration for later analysis.

T1588,"Rather than developing their own capabilities in-house, adversaries may purchase, freely download, or steal them."
T1588,"Activities may include the acquisition of malware, software , exploits, certificates, and information relating to vulnerabilities."
T1588,Adversaries may obtain capabilities to support their operations throughout numerous phases of the adversary lifecycle.
T1588,"In addition to downloading free malware, software, and exploits from the internet, adversaries may purchase these capabilities from third-party entities."
T1588,"Third-party entities can include technology companies that specialize in malware and exploits, criminal marketplaces, or from individuals."
T1588,"In addition to purchasing capabilities, adversaries may steal capabilities from third-party entities ."
T1588,"This can include stealing software licenses, malware, SSL/TLS and code-signing certificates, or raiding closed databases of vulnerabilities or exploits."

T1218,Cobalt Group has used odbcconf to proxy the execution of malicious DLL files.
T1137,Adversaries may leverage Microsoft Office-based applications for persistence between startups.
T1137,Microsoft Office is a fairly common application suite on Windows-based operating systems within an enterprise network.
T1137,There are multiple mechanisms that can be used with Office for persistence when an Office-based application is started; this can include the use of Office Template Macros and add-ins.
T1137,"A variety of features have been discovered in Outlook that can be abused to obtain persistence, such as Outlook rules, forms, and Home Page."
T1137,These persistence mechanisms can work within Outlook or be used through Office 365.
T1137,APT32 have replaced Microsoft Outlook's VbaProject.OTM file to install a backdoor macro for persistence.
T1137,"Gamaredon Group has inserted malicious macros into existing documents, providing persistence when they are reopened."
T1137,"Gamaredon Group has loaded the group's previously delivered VBA project by relaunching Microsoft Outlook with the /altvba option, once the Application.Startup event is received."
T1137,Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Office templates to obtain persistence on a compromised system.
T1137,Microsoft Office contains templates that are part of common Office applications and are used to customize styles.
T1137,The base templates within the application are used each time an application starts.
T1137,Office Visual Basic for Applications  macros  can be inserted into the base template and used to execute code when the respective Office application starts in order to obtain persistence.
T1137,Examples for both Word and Excel have been discovered and published.
T1137,"By default, Word has a Normal.dotm template created that can be modified to include a malicious macro."
T1137,"Excel does not have a template file created by default, but one can be added that will automatically be loaded."
T1137,Shared templates may also be stored and pulled from remote locations.
T1137,"Word Normal.dotm location:<br>
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Normal.dotm
Excel Personal.xlsb location:<br>
C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\PERSONAL.XLSB
Adversaries may also change the location of the base template to point to their own by hijacking the application's search order, e.g."
T1137,"Word 2016 will first look for Normal.dotm under C:\Program Files \Microsoft Office\root\Office16\, or by modifying the GlobalDotName registry key."
T1137,"By modifying the GlobalDotName registry key an adversary can specify an arbitrary location, file name, and file extension to use for the template that will be loaded on application startup."
T1137,"To abuse GlobalDotName, adversaries may first need to register the template as a trusted document or place it in a trusted location."
T1137,An adversary may need to enable macros to execute unrestricted depending on the system or enterprise security policy on use of macros.
T1137,BackConfig has the ability to use hidden columns in Excel spreadsheets to store executable files or commands for VBA macros.
T1137,Cobalt Strike has the ability to use an Excel Workbook to execute additional code by enabling Office to trust macros and execute code without user permission.
T1137,"MuddyWater has used a Word Template, Normal.dotm, for persistence."
T1137,"Adversaries may abuse the Microsoft Office ""Office Test"" Registry key to obtain persistence on a compromised system."
T1137,An Office Test Registry location exists that allows a user to specify an arbitrary DLL that will be executed every time an Office application is started.
T1137,This Registry key is thought to be used by Microsoft to load DLLs for testing and debugging purposes while developing Office applications.
T1137,This Registry key is not created by default during an Office installation.
T1137,"There exist user and global Registry keys for the Office Test feature:
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf
Adversaries may add this Registry key and specify a malicious DLL that will be executed whenever an Office application, such as Word or Excel, is started."
T1137,APT28 has used the Office Test persistence mechanism within Microsoft Office by adding the Registry key HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf to execute code.
T1102,"Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for sending commands to a compromised system without receiving return output over the Web service channel."
T1102,"Those infected systems may opt to send the output from those commands back over a different C2 channel, including to another distinct Web service."
T1102,"Alternatively, compromised systems may return no output at all in cases where adversaries want to send instructions to systems and do not want a response."
T1102,"The ""tDiscoverer"" variant of HAMMERTOSS establishes a C2 channel by downloading resources from Web services like Twitter and GitHub."
T1102,HAMMERTOSS binaries contain an algorithm that generates a different Twitter handle for the malware to check for instructions every day.
T1102,OnionDuke uses Twitter as a backup C2.
T1102,Metamorfo has downloaded a zip file for execution on the system.
T1102,EVILNUM has used a one-way communication method via GitLab and Digital Point to perform C2.
T1102,Leviathan has received C2 instructions from user profiles created on legitimate websites such as Github and TechNet.
T1137,Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Outlook forms to obtain persistence on a compromised system.
T1137,Outlook forms are used as templates for presentation and functionality in Outlook messages.
T1137,Custom Outlook forms can be created that will execute code when a specifically crafted email is sent by an adversary utilizing the same custom Outlook form.
T1137,"Once malicious forms have been added to the user’s mailbox, they will be loaded when Outlook is started."
T1137,Malicious forms will execute when an adversary sends a specifically crafted email to the user.
T1137,Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Outlook's Home Page feature to obtain persistence on a compromised system.
T1137,Outlook Home Page is a legacy feature used to customize the presentation of Outlook folders.
T1137,This feature allows for an internal or external URL to be loaded and presented whenever a folder is opened.
T1137,A malicious HTML page can be crafted that will execute code when loaded by Outlook Home Page.
T1137,"Once malicious home pages have been added to the user’s mailbox, they will be loaded when Outlook is started."
T1137,Malicious Home Pages will execute when the right Outlook folder is loaded/reloaded.
T1137,OilRig has abused the Outlook Home Page feature for persistence.
T1137,OilRig has also used CVE-2017-11774 to roll back the initial patch designed to protect against Home Page abuse.
T1137,Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Outlook rules to obtain persistence on a compromised system.
T1137,Outlook rules allow a user to define automated behavior to manage email messages.
T1137,"A benign rule might, for example, automatically move an email to a particular folder in Outlook if it contains specific words from a specific sender."
T1137,Malicious Outlook rules can be created that can trigger code execution when an adversary sends a specifically crafted email to that user.
T1137,"Once malicious rules have been added to the user’s mailbox, they will be loaded when Outlook is started."
T1137,Malicious rules will execute when an adversary sends a specifically crafted email to the user.
T1134,Adversaries may spoof the parent process identifier  of a new process to evade process-monitoring defenses or to elevate privileges.
T1134,"New processes are typically spawned directly from their parent, or calling, process unless explicitly specified."
T1134,"One way of explicitly assigning the PPID of a new process is via the CreateProcess API call, which supports a parameter that defines the PPID to use."
T1134,This functionality is used by Windows features such as User Account Control  to correctly set the PPID after a requested elevated process is spawned by SYSTEM  rather than the current user context.
T1134,"Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms to evade defenses, such as those blocking processes spawning directly from Office documents, and analysis targeting unusual/potentially malicious parent-child process relationships, such as spoofing the PPID of PowerShell/Rundll32 to be explorer.exe rather than an Office document delivered as part of Spearphishing Attachment."
T1134,This spoofing could be executed via Visual Basic within a malicious Office document or any code that can perform Native API.
T1134,Explicitly assigning the PPID may also enable elevated privileges given appropriate access rights to the parent process.
T1134,"For example, an adversary in a privileged user context  administrator may spawn a new process and assign the parent as a process running as SYSTEM , causing the new process to be elevated via the inherited access token."
T1134,PipeMon can use parent PID spoofing to elevate privileges.
T1134,Cobalt Strike can spawn processes with alternate PPIDs.
T1550,"Adversaries may “pass the hash” using stolen password hashes to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls."
T1550,Pass the hash  is a method of authenticating as a user without having access to the user's cleartext password.
T1550,"This method bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash."
T1550,"When performing PtH, valid password hashes for the account being used are captured using a Credential Access technique."
T1550,Captured hashes are used with PtH to authenticate as that user.
T1550,"Once authenticated, PtH may be used to perform actions on local or remote systems."
T1550,"Adversaries may also use stolen password hashes to ""overpass the hash."""
T1550,"Similar to PtH, this involves using a password hash to authenticate as a user but also uses the password hash to create a valid Kerberos ticket."
T1550,This ticket can then be used to perform Pass the Ticket attacks.
T1550,HOPLIGHT has been observed loading several APIs associated with Pass the Hash.
T1550,Cobalt Strike can perform pass the hash.
T1550,APT32 has used pass the hash for lateral movement.

T1550,Kimsuky has used pass the hash for authentication to remote access software used in C2.
T1550,Chimera has dumped password hashes for use in pass the hash authentication attacks.
T1550,"Adversaries may “pass the ticket” using stolen Kerberos tickets to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls."
T1550,Pass the ticket  is a method of authenticating to a system using Kerberos tickets without having access to an account's password.
T1550,Kerberos authentication can be used as the first step to lateral movement to a remote system.
T1550,"When preforming PtT, valid Kerberos tickets for Valid Accounts are captured by OS Credential Dumping."
T1550,"A user's service tickets or ticket granting ticket  may be obtained, depending on the level of access."
T1550,"A service ticket allows for access to a particular resource, whereas a TGT can be used to request service tickets from the Ticket Granting Service  to access any resource the user has privileges to access."
T1550,A Silver Ticket can be obtained for services that use Kerberos as an authentication mechanism and are used to generate tickets to access that particular resource and the system that hosts the resource .
T1550,"A Golden Ticket can be obtained for the domain using the Key Distribution Service account KRBTGT account NTLM hash, which enables generation of TGTs for any account in Active Directory."
T1550,"Adversaries may also create a valid Kerberos ticket using other user information, such as stolen password hashes or AES keys."
T1550,"For example, ""overpassing the hash"" involves using a NTLM password hash to authenticate as a user  Pass the Hash while also using the password hash to create a valid Kerberos ticket."
T1550,Some SeaDuke samples have a module to use pass the ticket with Kerberos for authentication.
T1550,APT29 used Kerberos ticket attacks for lateral movement.
T1550,BRONZE BUTLER has created forged Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket  and Ticket Granting Service  tickets to maintain administrative access.
T1550,APT32 successfully gained remote access by using pass the ticket.
T1110,"Adversaries may use password cracking to attempt to recover usable credentials, such as plaintext passwords, when credential material such as password hashes are obtained."
T1110,"OS Credential Dumping is used to obtain password hashes, this may only get an adversary so far when Pass the Hash is not an option."
T1110,"Techniques to systematically guess the passwords used to compute hashes are available, or the adversary may use a pre-computed rainbow table to crack hashes."
T1110,Cracking hashes is usually done on adversary-controlled systems outside of the target network.
T1110,"The resulting plaintext password resulting from a successfully cracked hash may be used to log into systems, resources, and services in which the account has access."
T1110,Net Crawler uses a list of known credentials gathered through credential dumping to guess passwords to accounts as it spreads throughout a network.
T1110,"Dragonfly 2.0 dropped and executed tools used for password cracking, including Hydra and CrackMapExec."
T1110,APT3 has been known to brute force password hashes to be able to leverage plain text credentials.
T1110,APT41 performed password brute-force attacks on the local admin account.
T1110,FIN6 has extracted password hashes from ntds.dit to crack offline.
T1556,Adversaries may register malicious password filter dynamic link libraries  into the authentication process to acquire user credentials as they are validated.
T1556,Windows password filters are password policy enforcement mechanisms for both domain and local accounts.
T1556,Filters are implemented as DLLs containing a method to validate potential passwords against password policies.
T1556,Filter DLLs can be positioned on local computers for local accounts and/or domain controllers for domain accounts.
T1556,"Before registering new passwords in the Security Accounts Manager , the Local Security Authority  requests validation from each registered filter."
T1556,Any potential changes cannot take effect until every registered filter acknowledges validation.
T1556,Adversaries can register malicious password filters to harvest credentials from local computers and/or entire domains.
T1556,"To perform proper validation, filters must receive plain-text credentials from the LSA."
T1556,A malicious password filter would receive these plain-text credentials every time a password request is made.
T1556,Remsec harvests plain-text credentials as a password filter registered on domain controllers.
T1556,"Strider has registered its persistence module on domain controllers as a Windows LSA  password filter to acquire credentials any time a domain, local user, or administrator logs in or changes a password."
T1110,Adversaries with no prior knowledge of legitimate credentials within the system or environment may guess passwords to attempt access to accounts.
T1110,"Without knowledge of the password for an account, an adversary may opt to systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism."
T1110,An adversary may guess login credentials without prior knowledge of system or environment passwords during an operation by using a list of common passwords.
T1110,Password guessing may or may not take into account the target's policies on password complexity or use policies that may lock accounts out after a number of failed attempts.
T1110,"Guessing passwords can be a risky option because it could cause numerous authentication failures and account lockouts, depending on the organization's login failure policies."
T1110,"Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when guessing passwords."
T1110,"In default environments, LDAP and Kerberos connection attempts are less likely to trigger events over SMB, which creates Windows ""logon failure"" event ID 4625."
T1110,Xbash can obtain a list of weak passwords from the C2 server to use for brute forcing as well as attempt to brute force services with open ports.
T1110,Emotet has been observed using a hard coded list of passwords to brute force user accounts.

T1110,"Webshell can use predefined users and passwords to execute brute force attacks against SSH, FTP, POP3, MySQL, MSSQL, and PostgreSQL services."
T1110,APT28 has used a brute-force/password-spray tooling that operated in two modes: in brute-force mode it typically sent over 300 authentication attempts per hour per targeted account over the course of several hours or days.
T1110,"APT28 has also used a Kubernetes cluster to conduct distributed, large-scale password guessing attacks."
T1555,Adversaries may acquire user credentials from third-party password managers.
T1555,"Password managers are applications designed to store user credentials, normally in an encrypted database."
T1555,Credentials are typically accessible after a user provides a master password that unlocks the database.
T1555,"After the database is unlocked, these credentials may be copied to memory."
T1555,These databases can be stored as files on disk.
T1555,Adversaries may acquire user credentials from password managers by extracting the master password and/or plain-text credentials from memory.
T1555,Adversaries may extract credentials from memory via Exploitation for Credential Access.
T1555,Adversaries may also try brute forcing via Password Guessing to obtain the master password of a password manager.
T1555,Proton gathers credentials in files for 1password.
T1555,TrickBot can steal passwords from the KeePass open source password manager.
T1555,MarkiRAT can gather information from the Keepass password manager.
T1555,Operation Wocao has accessed and collected credentials from password managers.
T1555,Fox Kitten has used scripts to access credential information from the KeePass database.
T1201,Adversaries may attempt to access detailed information about the password policy used within an enterprise network or cloud environment.
T1201,Password policies are a way to enforce complex passwords that are difficult to guess or crack through Brute Force.
T1201,This information may help the adversary to create a list of common passwords and launch dictionary and/or brute force attacks which adheres to the policy .
T1201,"Password policies can be set and discovered on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems via various command shell utilities such as net accounts , Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy, chage -l <username>, cat /etc/pam.d/common-password, and pwpolicy getaccountpolicies  ."
T1201,Password policies can be discovered in cloud environments using available APIs such as GetAccountPasswordPolicy in AWS .

T1201,Chimera has used the NtdsAudit utility to collect information related to accounts and passwords.
T1201,APT34 has used net.exe in a script with net accounts /domain to find the password policy of a domain.
T1110,Adversaries may use a single or small list of commonly used passwords against many different accounts to attempt to acquire valid account credentials.
T1110,"Password spraying uses one password , or a small list of commonly used passwords, that may match the complexity policy of the domain."
T1110,Logins are attempted with that password against many different accounts on a network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing a single account with many passwords.

T1601,Adversaries may modify the operating system of a network device to introduce new capabilities or weaken existing defenses.
T1601,"Some network devices are built with a monolithic architecture, where the entire operating system and most of the functionality of the device is contained within a single file."
T1601,"Adversaries may change this file in storage, to be loaded in a future boot, or in memory during runtime."
T1601,"To change the operating system in storage, the adversary will typically use the standard procedures available to device operators."
T1601,"This may involve downloading a new file via typical protocols used on network devices, such as TFTP, FTP, SCP, or a console connection."
T1601,"The original file may be overwritten, or a new file may be written alongside of it and the device reconfigured to boot to the compromised image."
T1601,"To change the operating system in memory, the adversary typically can use one of two methods."
T1601,"In the first, the adversary would make use of native debug commands in the original, unaltered running operating system that allow them to directly modify the relevant memory addresses containing the running operating system."
T1601,This method typically requires administrative level access to the device.
T1601,"In the second method for changing the operating system in memory, the adversary would make use of the boot loader."
T1601,"The boot loader is the first piece of software that loads when the device starts that, in turn, will launch the operating system."
T1601,"Adversaries may use malicious code previously implanted in the boot loader, such as through the ROMMONkit method, to directly manipulate running operating system code in memory."
T1601,"This malicious code in the bootloader provides the capability of direct memory manipulation to the adversary, allowing them to patch the live operating system during runtime."
T1601,"By modifying the instructions stored in the system image file, adversaries may either weaken existing defenses or provision new capabilities that the device did not have before."
T1601,"Examples of existing defenses that can be impeded include encryption, via Weaken Encryption, authentication, via Network Device Authentication, and perimeter defenses, via Network Boundary Bridging."
T1601,"Adding new capabilities for the adversary’s purpose include Keylogging, Multi-hop Proxy, and Port Knocking."
T1601,Adversaries may also compromise existing commands in the operating system to produce false output to mislead defenders.
T1601,"When this method is used in conjunction with Downgrade System Image, one example of a compromised system command may include changing the output of the command that shows the version of the currently running operating system."
T1601,"By patching the operating system, the adversary can change this command to instead display the original, higher revision number that they replaced through the system downgrade."
T1601,"When the operating system is patched in storage, this can be achieved in either the resident storage  or via TFTP Boot."
T1601,"When the technique is performed on the running operating system in memory and not on the stored copy, this technique will not survive across reboots."
T1601,"However, live memory modification of the operating system can be combined with ROMMONkit to achieve persistence."
T1601,SYNful Knock is malware that is inserted into a network device by patching the operating system image.
T1574,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables used to load libraries.
T1574,"Adversaries may place a program in an earlier entry in the list of directories stored in the PATH environment variable, which Windows will then execute when it searches sequentially through that PATH listing in search of the binary that was called from a script or the command line."
T1574,The PATH environment variable contains a list of directories.
T1574,Certain methods of executing a program  rely solely on the PATH environment variable to determine the locations that are searched for a program when the path for the program is not given.
T1574,"If any directories are listed in the PATH environment variable before the Windows directory, %SystemRoot%\system32 , a program may be placed in the preceding directory that is named the same as a Windows program , which will be executed when that command is executed from a script or command-line."
T1574,"For example, if C:\example path precedes C:\Windows\system32 is in the PATH environment variable, a program that is named net.exe and placed in C:\example path will be called instead of the Windows system ""net"" when ""net"" is executed from the command-line."
T1574,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs.
T1574,"Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program."
T1574,Search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path.
T1574,"Unlike DLL Search Order Hijacking, the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program."
T1574,"However, it is common for Windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows system directory."
T1574,"An adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking , a program that does not specify the path to an executable may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's directory."
T1574,"For example, ""example.exe"" runs ""cmd.exe"" with the command-line argument net user."
T1574,"An adversary may place a program called ""net.exe"" within the same directory as example.exe, ""net.exe"" will be run instead of the Windows system utility net."
T1574,"In addition, if an adversary places a program called ""net.com"" in the same directory as ""net.exe"", then cmd.exe /C net user will execute ""net.com"" instead of ""net.exe"" due to the order of executable extensions defined under PATHEXT."
T1574,Search order hijacking is also a common practice for hijacking DLL loads and is covered in DLL Search Order Hijacking.
T1574,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking vulnerable file path references.
T1574,"Adversaries can take advantage of paths that lack surrounding quotations by placing an executable in a higher level directory within the path, so that Windows will choose the adversary's executable to launch."
T1574,Service paths  and shortcut paths may also be vulnerable to path interception if the path has one or more spaces and is not surrounded by quotation marks .
T1574,"An adversary can place an executable in a higher level directory of the path, and Windows will resolve that executable instead of the intended executable."
T1574,"For example, if the path in a shortcut is C:\program files\myapp.exe, an adversary may create a program at C:\program.exe that will be run instead of the intended program."
T1574,"This technique can be used for persistence if executables are called on a regular basis, as well as privilege escalation if intercepted executables are started by a higher privileged process."
T1120,Adversaries may attempt to gather information about attached peripheral devices and components connected to a computer system.
T1120,"Peripheral devices could include auxiliary resources that support a variety of functionalities such as keyboards, printers, cameras, smart card readers, or removable storage."

T1547,Adversaries can modify property list files  to execute their code as part of establishing persistence.
T1547,Plist files are used by macOS applications to store properties and configuration settings for applications and services.
T1547,"Applications use information plist files, Info.plist, to tell the operating system how to handle the application at runtime using structured metadata in the form of keys and values."
T1547,Plist files are formatted in XML and based on Apple's Core Foundation DTD and can be saved in text or binary format.
T1547,"Adversaries can modify paths to executed binaries, add command line arguments, and insert key/pair values to plist files in auto-run locations which execute upon user logon or system startup."
T1547,"Through modifying plist files in these locations, adversaries can also execute a malicious dynamic library  by adding a dictionary containing the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES key combined with a path to a malicious dylib under the EnvironmentVariables key in a plist file."

T1556,Adversaries may modify pluggable authentication modules  to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts.
T1556,"PAM is a modular system of configuration files, libraries, and executable files which guide authentication for many services."
T1556,"The most common authentication module is pam_unix.so, which retrieves, sets, and verifies account authentication information in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow."
T1556,Adversaries may modify components of the PAM system to create backdoors.
T1556,"PAM components, such as pam_unix.so, can be patched to accept arbitrary adversary supplied values as legitimate credentials."
T1556,Malicious modifications to the PAM system may also be abused to steal credentials.
T1556,"Adversaries may infect PAM resources with code to harvest user credentials, since the values exchanged with PAM components may be plain-text since PAM does not store passwords."
T1556,Skidmap has the ability to replace the pam_unix.so file on an infected machine with its own malicious version that accepts a specific backdoor password for all users.
T1556,Ebury can deactivate PAM modules to tamper with the sshd configuration.
T1205,Adversaries may use port knocking to hide open ports used for persistence or command and control.
T1205,"To enable a port, an adversary sends a series of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports."
T1205,"After the sequence is completed, opening a port is often accomplished by the host based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software."
T1205,This technique has been observed to both for the dynamic opening of a listening port as well as the initiating of a connection to a listening server on a different system.
T1205,The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods.
T1205,"One means, originally implemented by Cd00r , is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question."
T1205,"Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs."
T1205,PROMETHIUM has used a script that configures the knockd service and firewall to only accept C2 connections from systems that use a specified sequence of knock ports.
T1547,Adversaries may use port monitors to run an attacker supplied DLL during system boot for persistence or privilege escalation.
T1547,A port monitor can be set through the AddMonitor API call to set a DLL to be loaded at startup.
T1547,"This DLL can be located in C:\Windows\System32 and will be loaded by the print spooler service, spoolsv.exe, on boot."
T1547,The spoolsv.exe process also runs under SYSTEM level permissions.
T1547,"Alternatively, an arbitrary DLL can be loaded if permissions allow writing a fully-qualified pathname for that DLL to HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors."
T1547,"The Registry key contains entries for the following:
* Local Port
* Standard TCP/IP Port
* USB Monitor
* WSD Port
Adversaries can use this technique to load malicious code at startup that will persist on system reboot and execute as SYSTEM."
T1055,Adversaries may inject portable executables  into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
T1055,PE injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
T1055,PE injection is commonly performed by copying code  into the virtual address space of the target process before invoking it via a new thread.
T1055,"The write can be performed with native Windows API calls such as VirtualAllocEx and WriteProcessMemory, then invoked with CreateRemoteThread or additional code ."
T1055,The displacement of the injected code does introduce the additional requirement for functionality to remap memory references.

T1059,Lazarus Group has used Powershell to download malicious payloads.
T1546,Adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by PowerShell profiles.
T1546,A PowerShell profile   is a script that runs when PowerShell starts and can be used as a logon script to customize user environments.
T1546,PowerShell supports several profiles depending on the user or host program.
T1546,"For example, there can be different profiles for PowerShell host programs such as the PowerShell console, PowerShell ISE or Visual Studio Code."
T1546,An administrator can also configure a profile that applies to all users and host programs on the local computer.
T1546,"Adversaries may modify these profiles to include arbitrary commands, functions, modules, and/or PowerShell drives to gain persistence."
T1546,Every time a user opens a PowerShell session the modified script will be executed unless the -NoProfile flag is used when it is launched.
T1546,"An adversary may also be able to escalate privileges if a script in a PowerShell profile is loaded and executed by an account with higher privileges, such as a domain administrator."
T1546,Turla has used PowerShell profiles to maintain persistence on an infected machine.
T1542,Adversaries may abuse Pre-OS Boot mechanisms as a way to establish persistence on a system.
T1542,"During the booting process of a computer, firmware and various startup services are loaded before the operating system."
T1542,These programs control flow of execution before the operating system takes control.
T1542,Adversaries may overwrite data in boot drivers or firmware such as BIOS  and The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface  to persist on systems at a layer below the operating system.
T1542,This can be particularly difficult to detect as malware at this level will not be detected by host software-based defenses.
T1547,Adversaries may abuse print processors to run malicious DLLs during system boot for persistence and/or privilege escalation.
T1547,"Print processors are DLLs that are loaded by the print spooler service, spoolsv.exe, during boot."
T1547,Adversaries may abuse the print spooler service by adding print processors that load malicious DLLs at startup.
T1547,A print processor can be installed through the AddPrintProcessor API call with an account that has SeLoadDriverPrivilege enabled.
T1547,"Alternatively, a print processor can be registered to the print spooler service by adding the HKLM\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet or ControlSet001\Control\Print\Environments\\Windows architecture: e.g., Windows x64\Print Processors\\user defined\Driver Registry key that points to the DLL."
T1547,"For the print processor to be correctly installed, it must be located in the system print-processor directory that can be found with the GetPrintProcessorDirectory API call."
T1547,"After the print processors are installed, the print spooler service, which starts during boot, must be restarted in order for them to run."
T1547,"The print spooler service runs under SYSTEM level permissions, therefore print processors installed by an adversary may run under elevated privileges."
T1547,The PipeMon installer has modified the Registry key HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environments\Windows x64\Print Processors to install PipeMon as a Print Processor.
T1552,Adversaries may search for private key certificate files on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials.
T1552,"Private cryptographic keys and certificates are used for authentication, encryption/decryption, and digital signatures."
T1552,"Common key and certificate file extensions include: .key, .pgp, .gpg, .ppk., .p12, .pem, .pfx, .cer, .p7b, .asc."
T1552,"Adversaries may also look in common key directories, such as ~/.ssh for SSH keys on * nix-based systems or C:&#92;Users&#92;&#92;.ssh&#92; on Windows."
T1552,These private keys can be used to authenticate to Remote Services like SSH or for use in decrypting other collected files such as email.
T1552,Adversary tools have been discovered that search compromised systems for file extensions relating to cryptographic keys and certificates.
T1552,"Some private keys require a password or passphrase for operation, so an adversary may also use Input Capture for keylogging or attempt to Brute Force the passphrase off-line."

T1552,TeamTNT has searched for unsecured SSH keys.
T1003,Adversaries may gather credentials from information stored in the Proc filesystem or /proc.
T1003,The Proc filesystem on Linux contains a great deal of information regarding the state of the running operating system.
T1003,Processes running with root privileges can use this facility to scrape live memory of other running programs.
T1003,"If any of these programs store passwords in clear text or password hashes in memory, these values can then be harvested for either usage or brute force attacks, respectively."
T1003,"This functionality has been implemented in the MimiPenguin, an open source tool inspired by Mimikatz."
T1003,"The tool dumps process memory, then harvests passwords and hashes by looking for text strings and regex patterns for how given applications such as Gnome Keyring, sshd, and Apache use memory to store such authentication artifacts."
T1055,Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via the /proc filesystem in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
T1055,Proc memory injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
T1055,Proc memory injection involves enumerating the memory of a process via the /proc filesystem  then crafting a return-oriented programming  payload with available gadgets/instructions.
T1055,"Each running process has its own directory, which includes memory mappings."
T1055,Proc memory injection is commonly performed by overwriting the target processes’ stack using memory mappings provided by the /proc filesystem.
T1055,This information can be used to enumerate offsets  and gadgets  otherwise hidden by process memory protections such as address space layout randomization .
T1055,"Once enumerated, the target processes’ memory map within /proc/pid/maps can be overwritten using dd."
T1055,Other techniques such as Dynamic Linker Hijacking may be used to populate a target process with more available gadgets.
T1055,"Similar to Process Hollowing, proc memory injection may target child processes ."
T1055,Execution via proc memory injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
T1057,Adversaries may attempt to get information about running processes on a system.
T1057,Information obtained could be used to gain an understanding of common software/applications running on systems within the network.
T1057,"Adversaries may use the information from Process Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions."
T1057,"In Windows environments, adversaries could obtain details on running processes using the Tasklist utility via cmd or Get-Process via PowerShell."
T1057,Information about processes can also be extracted from the output of Native API calls such as CreateToolhelp32Snapshot.

T1055,Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via process doppelgänging in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
T1055,Process doppelgänging is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
T1055,Windows Transactional NTFS  was introduced in Vista as a method to perform safe file operations.
T1055,"To ensure data integrity, TxF enables only one transacted handle to write to a file at a given time."
T1055,"Until the write handle transaction is terminated, all other handles are isolated from the writer and may only read the committed version of the file that existed at the time the handle was opened."
T1055,"To avoid corruption, TxF performs an automatic rollback if the system or application fails during a write transaction."
T1055,"Although deprecated, the TxF application programming interface  is still enabled as of Windows 10."
T1055,Adversaries may abuse TxF to a perform a file-less variation of Process Injection.
T1055,"Similar to Process Hollowing, process doppelgänging involves replacing the memory of a legitimate process, enabling the veiled execution of malicious code that may evade defenses and detection."
T1055,"Process doppelgänging's use of TxF also avoids the use of highly-monitored API functions such as NtUnmapViewOfSection, VirtualProtectEx, and SetThreadContext."
T1055,"Process Doppelgänging is implemented in 4 steps :
* Transact – Create a TxF transaction using a legitimate executable then overwrite the file with malicious code."
T1055,These changes will be isolated and only visible within the context of the transaction.
T1055,* Load – Create a shared section of memory and load the malicious executable.
T1055,"* Rollback – Undo changes to original executable, effectively removing malicious code from the file system."
T1055,* Animate – Create a process from the tainted section of memory and initiate execution.
T1055,This behavior will likely not result in elevated privileges since the injected process was spawned from  of the injecting process.
T1055,"However, execution via process doppelgänging may evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process."
T1055,SynAck abuses NTFS transactions to launch and conceal malicious processes.
T1055,Bazar can inject into a target process using process doppelgänging.
T1055,Leafminer has used Process Doppelgänging to evade security software while deploying tools on compromised systems.
T1055,Adversaries may inject malicious code into suspended and hollowed processes in order to evade process-based defenses.
T1055,Process hollowing is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
T1055,"Process hollowing is commonly performed by creating a process in a suspended state then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code."
T1055,"A victim process can be created with native Windows API calls such as CreateProcess, which includes a flag to suspend the processes primary thread."
T1055,"At this point the process can be unmapped using APIs calls such as ZwUnmapViewOfSection or NtUnmapViewOfSection  before being written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, SetThreadContext, then ResumeThread respectively."
T1055,This is very similar to Thread Local Storage but creates a new process rather than targeting an existing process.
T1055,"However, execution via process hollowing may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process."
T1055,Smoke Loader spawns a new copy of c:\windows\syswow64\explorer.exe and then replaces the executable code in memory with malware.

T1037,"Upon reboot, the system executes the script's contents as root, resulting in persistence."
T1037,"Adversary abuse of RC scripts is especially effective for lightweight Unix-like distributions using the root user as default, such as IoT or embedded systems."
T1037,Several Unix-like systems have moved to Systemd and deprecated the use of RC scripts.
T1037,This is now a deprecated mechanism in macOS in favor of Launchd.
T1037,This technique can be used on Mac OS X Panther v10.3 and earlier versions which still execute the RC scripts.
T1037,"To maintain backwards compatibility some systems, such as Ubuntu, will execute the RC scripts if they exist with the correct file permissions."
T1037,iKitten adds an entry to the rc.common file for persistence.
T1037,HiddenWasp installs reboot persistence by adding itself to /etc/rc.local.
T1563,Adversaries may hijack a legitimate user’s remote desktop session to move laterally within an environment.
T1563,Remote desktop is a common feature in operating systems.
T1563,It allows a user to log into an interactive session with a system desktop graphical user interface on a remote system.
T1563,Microsoft refers to its implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol  as Remote Desktop Services .
T1563,Adversaries may perform RDP session hijacking which involves stealing a legitimate user's remote session.
T1563,"Typically, a user is notified when someone else is trying to steal their session."
T1563,"With System permissions and using Terminal Services Console, `c:\windows\system32\tscon.exe session number to be stolen`, an adversary can hijack a session without the need for credentials or prompts to the user."
T1563,This can be done remotely or locally and with active or disconnected sessions.
T1563,It can also lead to Remote System Discovery and Privilege Escalation by stealing a Domain Admin or higher privileged account session.
T1563,"All of this can be done by using native Windows commands, but it has also been added as a feature in red teaming tools."
T1563,WannaCry enumerates current remote desktop sessions and tries to execute the malware on each session.
T1542,Adversaries may abuse the ROM Monitor  by loading an unauthorized firmware with adversary code to provide persistent access and manipulate device behavior that is difficult to detect.
T1542,"ROMMON is a Cisco network device firmware that functions as a boot loader, boot image, or boot helper to initialize hardware and software when the platform is powered on or reset."
T1542,"Similar to TFTP Boot, an adversary may upgrade the ROMMON image locally or remotely  with adversary code and restart the device in order to overwrite the existing ROMMON image."
T1542,This provides adversaries with the means to update the ROMMON to gain persistence on a system in a way that may be difficult to detect.
T1547,Adversaries may modify plist files to automatically run an application when a user logs in.
T1547,"Starting in Mac OS X 10.7 , users can specify certain applications to be re-opened when a user logs into their machine after reboot."
T1547,"While this is usually done via a Graphical User Interface  on an app-by-app basis, there are property list files  that contain this information as well located at ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist and ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost/com.apple.loginwindow."
T1547,* .plist.
T1547,An adversary can modify one of these files directly to include a link to their malicious executable to provide a persistence mechanism each time the user reboots their machine .
T1600,Adversaries may reduce the level of effort required to decrypt data transmitted over the network by reducing the cipher strength of encrypted communications.
T1600,Adversaries can weaken the encryption software on a compromised network device by reducing the key size used by the software to convert plaintext to ciphertext .
T1600,"As a result, adversaries dramatically reduce the amount of effort needed to decrypt the protected information without the key."
T1600,Adversaries may modify the key size used and other encryption parameters using specialized commands in a Network Device CLI introduced to the system through Modify System Image to change the configuration of the device.
T1498,Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service by reflecting a high-volume of network traffic to a target.
T1498,This type of Network DoS takes advantage of a third-party server intermediary that hosts and will respond to a given spoofed source IP address.
T1498,This third-party server is commonly termed a reflector.
T1498,An adversary accomplishes a reflection attack by sending packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim.
T1498,"Similar to Direct Network Floods, more than one system may be used to conduct the attack, or a botnet may be used."
T1498,"Likewise, one or more reflector may be used to focus traffic on the target."
T1498,"Reflection attacks often take advantage of protocols with larger responses than requests in order to amplify their traffic, commonly known as a Reflection Amplification attack."
T1498,Adversaries may be able to generate an increase in volume of attack traffic that is several orders of magnitude greater than the requests sent to the amplifiers.
T1498,"The extent of this increase will depending upon many variables, such as the protocol in question, the technique used, and the amplifying servers that actually produce the amplification in attack volume."
T1498,"Two prominent protocols that have enabled Reflection Amplification Floods are DNS and NTP, though the use of several others in the wild have been documented."
T1498,"In particular, the memcache protocol showed itself to be a powerful protocol, with amplification sizes up to 51,200 times the requesting packet."
T1620,Adversaries may reflectively load code into a process in order to conceal the execution of malicious payloads.
T1620,"Reflective loading involves allocating then executing payloads directly within the memory of the process, vice creating a thread or process backed by a file path on disk."
T1620,"Reflectively loaded payloads may be compiled binaries, anonymous files , or just snubs of fileless executable code ."
T1620,Reflective code injection is very similar to Process Injection except that the “injection” loads code into the processes’ own memory instead of that of a separate process.
T1620,Reflective loading may evade process-based detections since the execution of the arbitrary code may be masked within a legitimate or otherwise benign process.
T1620,"Reflectively loading payloads directly into memory may also avoid creating files or other artifacts on disk, while also enabling malware to keep these payloads encrypted  until execution."
T1620,Lokibot has reflectively loaded the decoded DLL into memory.
T1620,Cobalt Strike's execute-assembly command can run a .NET executable within the memory of a sacrificial process by loading the CLR.
T1620,ThiefQuest uses various API functions such as NSCreateObjectFileImageFromMemory to load and link in-memory payloads.
T1620,Cuba loaded the payload into memory using PowerShell.
T1547,Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program to a startup folder or referencing it with a Registry run key.
T1547,"Adding an entry to the ""run keys"" in the Registry or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in."
T1547,Placing a program within a startup folder will also cause that program to execute when a user logs in.
T1547,There is a startup folder location for individual user accounts as well as a system-wide startup folder that will be checked regardless of which user account logs in.
T1547,The startup folder path for the current user is C:\Users\\Username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup.
T1547,The startup folder path for all users is C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp.
T1547,"The following run keys are created by default on Windows systems:
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
Run keys may exist under multiple hives."
T1547,The HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx is also available but is not created by default on Windows Vista and newer.
T1547,Registry run key entries can reference programs directly or list them as a dependency.
T1547,"For example, it is possible to load a DLL at logon using a ""Depend"" key with RunOnceEx: reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx\0001\Depend /v 1 /d ""C:\temp\evil.dll"" 
The following Registry keys can be used to set startup folder items for persistence:
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
The following Registry keys can control automatic startup of services during boot:
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServicesOnce
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices
Using policy settings to specify startup programs creates corresponding values in either of two Registry keys:
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run
The Winlogon key controls actions that occur when a user logs on to a computer running Windows 7."
T1547,"Most of these actions are under the control of the operating system, but you can also add custom actions here."
T1547,The HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Userinit and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell subkeys can automatically launch programs.
T1547,Programs listed in the load value of the registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows run when any user logs on.
T1547,"By default, the multistring BootExecute value of the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager is set to autocheck autochk *."
T1547,"This value causes Windows, at startup, to check the file-system integrity of the hard disks if the system has been shut down abnormally."
T1547,Adversaries can add other programs or processes to this registry value which will automatically launch at boot.
T1547,"Adversaries can use these configuration locations to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots."
T1547,Briba creates run key Registry entries pointing to malicious DLLs dropped to disk.
T1547,"If establishing persistence by installation as a new service fails, one variant of Elise establishes persistence for the created .exe file by setting the following Registry key: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\svchost : %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Network\svchost.exe."

T1036,A JavaScript file named photo_high_re\u202Egnp.js will be displayed as photo_high_resj.png.
T1036,Adversaries may abuse the RTLO character as a means of tricking a user into executing what they think is a benign file type.
T1036,A common use of this technique is with Spearphishing Attachment/Malicious File since it can trick both end users and defenders if they are not aware of how their tools display and render the RTLO character.
T1036,Use of the RTLO character has been seen in many targeted intrusion attempts and criminal activity.
T1036,"RTLO can be used in the Windows Registry as well, where regedit.exe displays the reversed characters but the command line tool reg.exe does not by default."

T1207,"Once registered, a rogue DC may be able to inject and replicate changes into AD infrastructure for any domain object, including credentials and keys."
T1207,"Registering a rogue DC involves creating a new server and nTDSDSA objects in the Configuration partition of the AD schema, which requires Administrator privileges  or the KRBTGT hash."
T1207,This technique may bypass system logging and security monitors such as security information and event management  products .
T1207,The technique may also be used to alter and delete replication and other associated metadata to obstruct forensic analysis.
T1207,Adversaries may also utilize this technique to perform SID-History Injection and/or manipulate AD objects  to establish backdoors for Persistence.
T1014,"Adversaries may use rootkits to hide the presence of programs, files, network connections, services, drivers, and other system components."
T1014,Rootkits are programs that hide the existence of malware by intercepting/hooking and modifying operating system API calls that supply system information.

T1564,Adversaries may carry out malicious operations using a virtual instance to avoid detection.
T1564,A wide variety of virtualization technologies exist that allow for the emulation of a computer or computing environment.
T1564,"By running malicious code inside of a virtual instance, adversaries can hide artifacts associated with their behavior from security tools that are unable to monitor activity inside the virtual instance."
T1564,"Additionally, depending on the virtual networking implementation , network traffic generated by the virtual instance can be difficult to trace back to the compromised host as the IP address and hostname might not match known values."
T1564,Adversaries may utilize native support for virtualization  or drop the necessary files to run a virtual instance .

T1134,Adversaries may use SID-History Injection to escalate privileges and bypass access controls.
T1134,The Windows security identifier  is a unique value that identifies a user or group account.
T1134,SIDs are used by Windows security in both security descriptors and access tokens.
T1134,"An account can hold additional SIDs in the SID-History Active Directory attribute , allowing inter-operable account migration between domains ."
T1134,"With Domain Administrator  rights, harvested or well-known SID values  may be inserted into SID-History to enable impersonation of arbitrary users/groups such as Enterprise Administrators."
T1134,"This manipulation may result in elevated access to local resources and/or access to otherwise inaccessible domains via lateral movement techniques such as Remote Services, SMB/Windows Admin Shares, or Windows Remote Management."
T1553,Adversaries may tamper with SIP and trust provider components to mislead the operating system and application control tools when conducting signature validation checks.
T1553,"In user mode, Windows Authenticode  digital signatures are used to verify a file's origin and integrity, variables that may be used to establish trust in signed code ."
T1553,"The signature validation process is handled via the WinVerifyTrust application programming interface  function,   which accepts an inquiry and coordinates with the appropriate trust provider, which is responsible for validating parameters of a signature."
T1553,"Because of the varying executable file types and corresponding signature formats, Microsoft created software components called Subject Interface Packages   to provide a layer of abstraction between API functions and files."
T1553,"SIPs are responsible for enabling API functions to create, retrieve, calculate, and verify signatures."
T1553,Unique SIPs exist for most file formats  and are identified by globally unique identifiers .
T1553,"Similar to Code Signing, adversaries may abuse this architecture to subvert trust controls and bypass security policies that allow only legitimately signed code to execute on a system."
T1553,"Adversaries may hijack SIP and trust provider components to mislead operating system and application control tools to classify malicious  code as signed by: 
* Modifying the Dll and FuncName Registry values in HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Cryptography\OID\EncodingType 0\CryptSIPDllGetSignedDataMsg\{SIP_GUID} that point to the dynamic link library  providing a SIP’s CryptSIPDllGetSignedDataMsg function, which retrieves an encoded digital certificate from a signed file."
T1553,"By pointing to a maliciously-crafted DLL with an exported function that always returns a known good signature value  rather than the file’s real signature, an adversary can apply an acceptable signature value to all files using that SIP  ."
T1553,"* Modifying the Dll and FuncName Registry values in HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Cryptography\OID\EncodingType 0\CryptSIPDllVerifyIndirectData\{SIP_GUID} that point to the DLL providing a SIP’s CryptSIPDllVerifyIndirectData function, which validates a file’s computed hash against the signed hash value."
T1553,"By pointing to a maliciously-crafted DLL with an exported function that always returns TRUE , an adversary can successfully validate any file  using that SIP  ."
T1553,"This Registry value could also be redirected to a suitable exported function from an already present DLL, avoiding the requirement to drop and execute a new file on disk."
T1553,"* Modifying the DLL and Function Registry values in HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Cryptography\Providers\Trust\FinalPolicy\{trust provider GUID} that point to the DLL providing a trust provider’s FinalPolicy function, which is where the decoded and parsed signature is checked and the majority of trust decisions are made."
T1553,"Similar to hijacking SIP’s CryptSIPDllVerifyIndirectData function, this value can be redirected to a suitable exported function from an already present DLL or a maliciously-crafted DLL ."
T1553,* **Note:** The above hijacks are also possible without modifying the Registry via DLL Search Order Hijacking.
T1553,"Hijacking SIP or trust provider components can also enable persistent code execution, since these malicious components may be invoked by any application that performs code signing or signature validation."

T1602,Adversaries may target the Management Information Base  to collect and/or mine valuable information in a network managed using Simple Network Management Protocol .
T1602,The MIB is a configuration repository that stores variable information accessible via SNMP in the form of object identifiers .
T1602,"Each OID identifies a variable that can be read or set and permits active management tasks, such as configuration changes, through remote modification of these variables."
T1602,"SNMP can give administrators great insight in their systems, such as, system information, description of hardware, physical location, and software packages."
T1602,"The MIB may also contain device operational information, including running configuration, routing table, and interface details."
T1602,Adversaries may use SNMP queries to collect MIB content directly from SNMP-managed devices in order to collect network information that allows the adversary to build network maps and facilitate future targeted exploitation.
T1505,Adversaries may abuse SQL stored procedures to establish persistent access to systems.
T1505,SQL Stored Procedures are code that can be saved and reused so that database users do not waste time rewriting frequently used SQL queries.
T1505,Stored procedures can be invoked via SQL statements to the database using the procedure name or via defined events .
T1505,Adversaries may craft malicious stored procedures that can provide a persistence mechanism in SQL database servers.
T1505,"To execute operating system commands through SQL syntax the adversary may have to enable additional functionality, such as xp_cmdshell for MSSQL Server."

T1098,Adversaries may modify the SSH authorized_keys file to maintain persistence on a victim host.
T1098,Linux distributions and macOS commonly use key-based authentication to secure the authentication process of SSH sessions for remote management.
T1098,The authorized_keys file in SSH specifies the SSH keys that can be used for logging into the user account for which the file is configured.
T1098,This file is usually found in the user's home directory under &lt;user-home&gt;/.ssh/authorized_keys.
T1098,Users may edit the system’s SSH config file to modify the directives PubkeyAuthentication and RSAAuthentication to the value “yes” to ensure public key and RSA authentication are enabled.
T1098,The SSH config file is usually located under /etc/ssh/sshd_config.
T1098,Adversaries may modify SSH authorized_keys files directly with scripts or shell commands to add their own adversary-supplied public keys.
T1098,This ensures that an adversary possessing the corresponding private key may log in as an existing user via SSH.
T1098,Skidmap has the ability to add the public key of its handlers to the authorized_keys file to maintain persistence on an infected host.
T1098,Bundlore creates a new key pair with ssh-keygen and drops the newly created user key in authorized_keys to enable remote login.

T1499,"Web server software can be attacked through a variety of means, some of which apply generally while others are specific to the software being used to provide the service."
T1499,"One example of this type of attack is known as a simple HTTP flood, where an adversary sends a large number of HTTP requests to a web server to overwhelm it and/or an application that runs on top of it."
T1499,"This flood relies on raw volume to accomplish the objective, exhausting any of the various resources required by the victim software to provide the service."
T1499,"Another variation, known as a SSL renegotiation attack, takes advantage of a protocol feature in SSL/TLS."
T1499,The SSL/TLS protocol suite includes mechanisms for the client and server to agree on an encryption algorithm to use for subsequent secure connections.
T1499,"If SSL renegotiation is enabled, a request can be made for renegotiation of the crypto algorithm."
T1499,"In a renegotiation attack, the adversary establishes a SSL/TLS connection and then proceeds to make a series of renegotiation requests."
T1499,"Because the cryptographic renegotiation has a meaningful cost in computation cycles, this can cause an impact to the availability of the service when done in volume."
T1489,Adversaries may stop or disable services on a system to render those services unavailable to legitimate users.
T1489,Stopping critical services or processes can inhibit or stop response to an incident or aid in the adversary's overall objectives to cause damage to the environment.

T1574,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by services.
T1574,Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions of Windows services to replace the binary that is executed upon service start.
T1574,These service processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions.
T1574,"If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process."
T1574,"One variant of BlackEnergy locates existing driver services that have been disabled and drops its driver component into one of those service's paths, replacing the legitimate executable."

T1574,Windows stores local service configuration information in the Registry under HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services.
T1574,"The information stored under a service's Registry keys can be manipulated to modify a service's execution parameters through tools such as the service controller, sc.exe,  PowerShell, or Reg."
T1574,Access to Registry keys is controlled through access control lists and user permissions.
T1574,"If the permissions for users and groups are not properly set and allow access to the Registry keys for a service, adversaries may change the service's binPath/ImagePath to point to a different executable under their control."
T1574,"When the service starts or is restarted, then the adversary-controlled program will execute, allowing the adversary to establish persistence and/or privilege escalation to the account context the service is set to execute under ."
T1574,Adversaries may also alter other Registry keys in the service’s Registry tree.
T1574,"For example, the FailureCommand key may be changed so that the service is executed in an elevated context anytime the service fails or is intentionally corrupted."
T1574,The Performance key contains the name of a driver service's performance DLL and the names of several exported functions in the DLL.
T1574,"If the Performance key is not already present and if an adversary-controlled user has the Create Subkey permission, adversaries may create the Performance key in the service’s Registry tree to point to a malicious DLL."
T1574,"Adversaries may also add the Parameters key, which stores driver-specific data, or other custom subkeys for their malicious services to establish persistence or enable other malicious activities."
T1574,"Additionally, If adversaries launch their malicious services using svchost.exe, the service’s file may be identified using HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\servicename\Parameters\ServiceDll."
T1548,An adversary may perform shell escapes or exploit vulnerabilities in an application with the setsuid or setgid bits to get code running in a different user’s context.
T1548,"On Linux or macOS, when the setuid or setgid bits are set for an application, the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively. ."
T1548,"Normally an application is run in the current user’s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application."
T1548,"However, there are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them doesn’t need the elevated privileges."
T1548,"Instead of creating an entry in the sudoers file, which must be done by root, any user can specify the setuid or setgid flag to be set for their own applications."
T1548,"These bits are indicated with an ""s"" instead of an ""x"" when viewing a file's attributes via ls -l. The chmod program can set these bits with via bitmasking, chmod 4777 file or via shorthand naming, chmod u+s file."
T1548,Adversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure they're able to execute in elevated contexts in the future.. Keydnap adds the setuid flag to a binary so it can easily elevate in the future.
T1548,Exaramel for Linux can execute commands with high privileges via a specific binary with setuid functionality.
T1129,Adversaries may execute malicious payloads via loading shared modules.
T1129,The Windows module loader can be instructed to load DLLs from arbitrary local paths and arbitrary Universal Naming Convention  network paths.
T1129,"This functionality resides in NTDLL.dll and is part of the Windows Native API which is called from functions like CreateProcess, LoadLibrary, etc."
T1129,of the Win32 API.
T1129,"The module loader can load DLLs:
* via specification of the  DLL pathname in the IMPORT directory;
* via EXPORT forwarded to another DLL, specified with  pathname ;
* via an NTFS junction or symlink program.exe.local with the fully-qualified or relative pathname of a directory containing the DLLs specified in the IMPORT directory or forwarded EXPORTs;
* via &#x3c;file name=""filename.extension"" loadFrom=""fully-qualified or relative pathname""&#x3e; in an embedded or external ""application manifest""."
T1129,The file name refers to an entry in the IMPORT directory or a forwarded EXPORT.

T1213,"For example, the following is a list of example information that may hold potential value to an adversary and may also be found on SharePoint:
* Policies, procedures, and standards
* Physical / logical network diagrams
* System architecture diagrams
* Technical system documentation
* Testing / development credentials
* Work / project schedules
* Source code snippets
* Links to network shares and other internal resources

T1213,Chimera has collected documents from the victim's SharePoint.
T1547,Adversaries may create or edit shortcuts to run a program during system boot or user login.
T1547,Shortcuts or symbolic links are ways of referencing other files or programs that will be opened or executed when the shortcut is clicked or executed by a system startup process.
T1547,Adversaries could use shortcuts to execute their tools for persistence.

T1036,Adversaries can hide a program's true filetype by changing the extension of a file.
T1036,"With certain file types , appending a space to the end of a filename will change how the file is processed by the operating system."
T1036,"For example, if there is a Mach-O executable file called evil.bin, when it is double clicked by a user, it will launch Terminal.app and execute."
T1036,"If this file is renamed to evil.txt, then when double clicked by a user, it will launch with the default text editing application ."
T1036,"However, if the file is renamed to evil.txt  , then when double clicked by a user, the true file type is determined by the OS and handled appropriately and the binary will be executed ."
T1036,Adversaries can use this feature to trick users into double clicking benign-looking files of any format and ultimately executing something malicious.
T1036,Keydnap puts a space after a false .jpg extension so that execution actually goes through the Terminal.app program.
T1566,Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems.
T1566,Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing.
T1566,Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email.
T1566,"All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry."
T1566,"In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution to gain execution."
T1566,"Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source."
T1566,"There are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files."
T1566,"Upon opening the attachment , the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system."
T1566,"The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so."
T1566,"The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses."
T1566,"Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one."
