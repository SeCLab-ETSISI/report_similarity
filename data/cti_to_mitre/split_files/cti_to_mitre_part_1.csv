T1003,Adversaries may attempt to dump the contents of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to enable offline password cracking.
T1003,Most modern Linux operating systems use a combination of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to store user account information including password hashes in /etc/shadow.
T1003,"By default, /etc/shadow is only readable by the root user."
T1003,"The Linux utility, unshadow, can be used to combine the two files in a format suited for password cracking utilities such as John the Ripper: # /usr/bin/unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > /tmp/crack.password.db"
T1557,Adversaries may poison Address Resolution Protocol  caches to position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices.
T1557,This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as Network Sniffing or Transmitted Data Manipulation.
T1557,"The ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control  address."
T1557,Devices in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses.
T1557,"If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address."
T1557,The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address.
T1557,The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.
T1557,An adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device.
T1557,"The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device."
T1557,"For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner."
T1557,Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.
T1557,The ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication.
T1557,"Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache."
T1557,Adversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic.
T1557,"This activity may be used to collect and/or relay data such as credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol."
T1557,Cleaver has used custom tools to facilitate ARP cache poisoning.
T1558,Adversaries may reveal credentials of accounts that have disabled Kerberos preauthentication by Password Cracking Kerberos messages.
T1558,Preauthentication offers protection against offline Password Cracking.
T1558,"When enabled, a user requesting access to a resource initiates communication with the Domain Controller  by sending an Authentication Server Request  message with a timestamp that is encrypted with the hash of their password."
T1558,"If and only if the DC is able to successfully decrypt the timestamp with the hash of the user’s password, it will then send an Authentication Server Response  message that contains the Ticket Granting Ticket  to the user."
T1558,Part of the AS-REP message is signed with the user’s password.
T1558,"For each account found without preauthentication, an adversary may send an AS-REQ message without the encrypted timestamp and receive an AS-REP message with TGT data which may be encrypted with an insecure algorithm such as RC4."
T1558,The recovered encrypted data may be vulnerable to offline Password Cracking attacks similarly to Kerberoasting and expose plaintext credentials.
T1558,"An account registered to a domain, with or without special privileges, can be abused to list all domain accounts that have preauthentication disabled by utilizing Windows tools like PowerShell with an LDAP filter."
T1558,"Alternatively, the adversary may send an AS-REQ message for each user."
T1558,"If the DC responds without errors, the account does not require preauthentication and the AS-REP message will already contain the encrypted data."
T1558,"Cracked hashes may enable Persistence, Privilege Escalation, and Lateral Movement via access to Valid Accounts."
T1548,Adversaries may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevate privileges to gain higher-level permissions.
T1548,Most modern systems contain native elevation control mechanisms that are intended to limit privileges that a user can perform on a machine.
T1548,Authorization has to be granted to specific users in order to perform tasks that can be considered of higher risk.
T1548,An adversary can perform several methods to take advantage of built-in control mechanisms in order to escalate privileges on a system.
T1134,Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls.
T1134,Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process.
T1134,A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process.
T1134,"When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token."
T1134,An adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing.
T1134,These token can then be applied to an existing process  Token Impersonation/Theft or used to spawn a new process  Create Process with Token.
T1134,An adversary must already be in a privileged user context  administrator to steal a token.
T1134,"However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level."
T1134,An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.
T1134,"Any standard user can use the runas command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator account."
T1134,"There are also other mechanisms, such as Active Directory fields, that can be used to modify access tokens."
T1134,Duqu examines running system processes for tokens that have specific system privileges.
T1134,"If it finds one, it will copy the token and store it for later use."
T1134,Eventually it will start new processes with the stored token attached.
T1134,It can also steal tokens to acquire administrative privileges.
T1134,Hydraq creates a backdoor through which remote attackers can adjust token privileges.
T1134,SslMM contains a feature to manipulate process privileges and tokens.
T1134,Ryuk has attempted to adjust its token privileges to have the SeDebugPrivilege.
T1134,SUNSPOT modified its security token to grants itself debugging privileges by adding SeDebugPrivilege.
T1134,MegaCortex can enable SeDebugPrivilege and adjust token privileges.
T1134,AppleSeed can gain system level privilege by passing SeDebugPrivilege to the AdjustTokenPrivilege API.
T1134,Cuba has used SeDebugPrivilege and AdjustTokenPrivileges to elevate privileges.
T1134,KillDisk has attempted to get the access token of a process by calling OpenProcessToken.
T1134,"If KillDisk gets the access token, then it attempt to modify the token privileges with AdjustTokenPrivileges."
T1134,Blue Mockingbird has used JuicyPotato to abuse the SeImpersonate token privilege to escalate from web application pool accounts to NT Authority\SYSTEM.
T1134,FIN6 has used has used Metasploit’s named-pipe impersonation technique to escalate privileges.
T1546,Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by accessibility features.
T1546,Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in .
T1546,An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.
T1546,"Two common accessibility programs are C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe, launched when the shift key is pressed five times and C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe, launched when the Windows + U key combination is pressed."
T1546,"The sethc.exe program is often referred to as ""sticky keys"", and has been used by adversaries for unauthenticated access through a remote desktop login screen."
T1546,"Depending on the version of Windows, an adversary may take advantage of these features in different ways."
T1546,Common methods used by adversaries include replacing accessibility feature binaries or pointers/references to these binaries in the Registry.
T1546,"In newer versions of Windows, the replaced binary needs to be digitally signed for x64 systems, the binary must reside in %systemdir%\, and it must be protected by Windows File or Resource Protection ."
T1546,The Image File Execution Options Injection debugger method was likely discovered as a potential workaround because it does not require the corresponding accessibility feature binary to be replaced.
T1546,"For simple binary replacement on Windows XP and later as well as and Windows Server 2003/R2 and later, for example, the program  may be replaced with ""cmd.exe"" ."
T1546,"Subsequently, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while sitting at the keyboard or when connected over Remote Desktop Protocol will cause the replaced file to be executed with SYSTEM privileges."
T1546,"Other accessibility features exist that may also be leveraged in a similar fashion: 
* On-Screen Keyboard: C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe
* Magnifier: C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe
* Narrator: C:\Windows\System32\Narrator.exe
* Display Switcher: C:\Windows\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe
* App Switcher: C:\Windows\System32\AtBroker.exe Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by accessibility features."
T1546,"Other accessibility features exist that may also be leveraged in a similar fashion: 
* On-Screen Keyboard: C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe
* Magnifier: C:\Windows\System32\Magnify.exe
* Narrator: C:\Windows\System32\Narrator.exe
* Display Switcher: C:\Windows\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe
* App Switcher: C:\Windows\System32\AtBroker.exe APT3 replaces the Sticky Keys binary C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe for persistence."
T1546,"APT29 used sticky-keys to obtain unauthenticated, privileged console access."
T1546,Deep Panda has used the sticky-keys technique to bypass the RDP login screen on remote systems during intrusions.
T1546,Axiom actors have been known to use the Sticky Keys replacement within RDP sessions to obtain persistence.
T1546,APT41 leveraged sticky keys to establish persistence.
T1546,Fox Kitten has used sticky keys to launch a command prompt.
T1531,Adversaries may interrupt availability of system and network resources by inhibiting access to accounts utilized by legitimate users.
T1531,"Accounts may be deleted, locked, or manipulated  to remove access to accounts."
T1531,Adversaries may also subsequently log off and/or reboot boxes to set malicious changes into place.
T1531,LockerGoga has been observed changing account passwords and logging off current users.
T1531,MegaCortex has changed user account passwords and logged users off the system.
T1087,Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of accounts on a system or within an environment.
T1087,This information can help adversaries determine which accounts exist to aid in follow-on behavior.
T1087,"XCSSET attempts to discover accounts from various locations such as a user's Evernote, AppleID, Telegram, Skype, and WeChat data."
T1087,UNC2452 obtained a list of users and their roles from an Exchange server using Get-ManagementRoleAssignment.
T1087,APT29 obtained a list of users and their roles from an Exchange server using Get-ManagementRoleAssignment.
T1087,"APT32 enumerated administrative users and DC servers using the commands net localgroup administrators and net group ""Domain Controllers"" /domain."
T1098,Adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain access to victim systems.
T1098,"Account manipulation may consist of any action that preserves adversary access to a compromised account, such as modifying credentials or permission groups."
T1098,"These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies, such as performing iterative password updates to bypass password duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials."
T1098,"In order to create or manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient permissions on systems or the domain."
T1098,Calisto adds permissions and remote logins to all users.
T1098,SMOKEDHAM has added created user accounts to local Admin groups.
T1098,Lazarus Group malware WhiskeyDelta-Two contains a function that attempts to rename the administrator’s account.
T1098,APT3 has been known to add created accounts to local admin groups to maintain elevated access.
T1098,Dragonfly 2.0 added newly created accounts to the administrators group to maintain elevated access.
T1098,Sandworm Team used the sp_addlinkedsrvlogin command in MS-SQL to create a link between a created account and other servers in the network.
T1098,Magic Hound granted compromised email accounts read access to the email boxes of additional targeted accounts.
T1098,The group then was able to authenticate to the intended victim's OWA  portal and read hundreds of email communications for information on Middle East organizations.
T1583,"Adversaries may buy, lease, or rent infrastructure that can be used during targeting."
T1583,A wide variety of infrastructure exists for hosting and orchestrating adversary operations.
T1583,"Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains, and third-party web services."
T1583,"Additionally, botnets are available for rent or purchase."
T1583,"Use of these infrastructure solutions allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation."
T1583,"Solutions may help adversary operations blend in with traffic that is seen as normal, such as contact to third-party web services."
T1583,"Depending on the implementation, adversaries may use infrastructure that makes it difficult to physically tie back to them as well as utilize infrastructure that can be rapidly provisioned, modified, and shut down."
T1595,Adversaries may execute active reconnaissance scans to gather information that can be used during targeting.
T1595,"Active scans are those where the adversary probes victim infrastructure via network traffic, as opposed to other forms of reconnaissance that do not involve direct interaction."
T1595,Adversaries may perform different forms of active scanning depending on what information they seek to gather.
T1595,"These scans can also be performed in various ways, including using native features of network protocols such as ICMP."
T1595,"Information from these scans may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance  or Search Open Technical Databases, establishing operational resources  or Obtain Capabilities, and/or initial access  or Exploit Public-Facing Application."
T1547,Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a Registry key to the Active Setup of the local machine.
T1547,Active Setup is a Windows mechanism that is used to execute programs when a user logs in.
T1547,The value stored in the Registry key will be executed after a user logs into the computer.
T1547,These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.
T1547,Adversaries may abuse Active Setup by creating a key under  HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\ and setting a malicious value for StubPath.
T1547,This value will serve as the program that will be executed when a user logs into the computer.
T1547,"Adversaries can abuse these components to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots."
T1547,Adversaries may also use Masquerading to make the Registry entries look as if they are associated with legitimate programs.
T1547,PoisonIvy creates a Registry key in the Active Setup pointing to a malicious executable.
T1098,An adversary may add the Global Administrator role to an adversary-controlled account to maintain persistent access to an Office 365 tenant.
T1098,"With sufficient permissions, a compromised account can gain almost unlimited access to data and settings  via the global admin role."
T1098,This account modification may immediately follow Create Account or other malicious account activity.
T1137,Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Office add-ins to obtain persistence on a compromised system.
T1137,Office add-ins can be used to add functionality to Office programs.
T1137,"There are different types of add-ins that can be used by the various Office products; including Word/Excel add-in Libraries , VBA add-ins, Office Component Object Model  add-ins, automation add-ins, VBA Editor , Visual Studio Tools for Office  add-ins, and Outlook add-ins."
T1137,Add-ins can be used to obtain persistence because they can be set to execute code when an Office application starts.
T1137,"Naikon has used the RoyalRoad exploit builder to drop a second stage loader, intel.wll, into the Word Startup folder on the compromised host."
T1098,Adversaries may add adversary-controlled credentials to a cloud account to maintain persistent access to victim accounts and instances within the environment.
T1098,Adversaries may add credentials for Service Principals and Applications in addition to existing legitimate credentials in Azure AD.
T1098,These credentials include both x509 keys and passwords.
T1098,"With sufficient permissions, there are a variety of ways to add credentials including the Azure Portal, Azure command line interface, and Azure or Az PowerShell modules."
T1098,"In infrastructure-as-a-service  environments, after gaining access through Cloud Accounts, adversaries may generate or import their own SSH keys using either the CreateKeyPair or ImportKeyPair API in AWS or the gcloud compute os-login ssh-keys add command in GCP."
T1098,This allows persistent access to instances within the cloud environment without further usage of the compromised cloud accounts.
T1098,UNC2452 added credentials to OAuth Applications and Service Principals.
T1098,APT29 has added credentials to OAuth Applications and Service Principals.
T1557,Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices using an adversary-in-the-middle  technique to support follow-on behaviors such as Network Sniffing or Transmitted Data Manipulation.
T1557,"By abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the flow of network traffic , adversaries may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform additional actions."
T1557,"Adversaries may leverage the AiTM position to attempt to modify traffic, such as in Transmitted Data Manipulation."
T1557,"Adversaries can also stop traffic from flowing to the appropriate destination, causing denial of service."
T1557,Dok proxies web traffic to potentially monitor and alter victim HTTP traffic.
T1557,Kimsuky has used modified versions of PHProxy to examine web traffic between the victim and the accessed website.
T1546,Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppCert DLLs loaded into processes.
T1546,"Dynamic-link libraries  that are specified in the AppCertDLLs Registry key under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\ are loaded into every process that calls the ubiquitously used application programming interface  functions CreateProcess, CreateProcessAsUser, CreateProcessWithLoginW, CreateProcessWithTokenW, or WinExec."
T1546,"Similar to Process Injection, this value can be abused to obtain elevated privileges by causing a malicious DLL to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer."
T1546,Malicious AppCert DLLs may also provide persistence by continuously being triggered by API activity.
T1546,PUNCHBUGGY can establish using a AppCertDLLs Registry key.
T1546,Honeybee's service-based DLL implant can execute a downloaded file with parameters specified using CreateProcessAsUser.
T1546,Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppInit DLLs loaded into processes.
T1546,Dynamic-link libraries  that are specified in the AppInit_DLLs value in the Registry keys HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows are loaded by user32.dll into every process that loads user32.dll.
T1546,"In practice this is nearly every program, since user32.dll is a very common library."
T1546,"Similar to Process Injection, these values can be abused to obtain elevated privileges by causing a malicious DLL to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer."
T1546,Malicious AppInit DLLs may also provide persistence by continuously being triggered by API activity.
T1546,The AppInit DLL functionality is disabled in Windows 8 and later versions when secure boot is enabled.
T1546,"If a victim meets certain criteria, T9000 uses the AppInit_DLL functionality to achieve persistence by ensuring that every user mode process that is spawned will load its malicious DLL, ResN32.dll."
T1546,It does this by creating the following Registry keys: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\AppInit_DLLs – %APPDATA%\Intel\ResN32.dll and HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows\LoadAppInit_DLLs – 0x1.
T1546,"Some variants of Cherry Picker use AppInit_DLLs to achieve persistence by creating the following Registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows ""AppInit_DLLs""=""pserver32.dll"" Ramsay can insert itself into the address space of other applications using the AppInit DLL Registry key."
T1546,APT39 has used malware to set LoadAppInit_DLLs in the Registry key SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows in order to establish persistence.
T1059,Adversaries may abuse AppleScript for execution.
T1059,AppleScript is a macOS scripting language designed to control applications and parts of the OS via inter-application messages called AppleEvents.
T1059,These AppleEvent messages can be sent independently or easily scripted with AppleScript.
T1059,"These events can locate open windows, send keystrokes, and interact with almost any open application locally or remotely."
T1059,"Scripts can be run from the command-line via osascript /path/to/script or osascript -e ""script here""."
T1059,"Aside from the command line, scripts can be executed in numerous ways including Mail rules, Calendar.app alarms, and Automator workflows."
T1059,AppleScripts can also be executed as plain text shell scripts by adding #!/usr/bin/osascript to the start of the script file.
T1059,"AppleScripts do not need to call osascript to execute, however."
T1059,"They may be executed from within mach-O binaries by using the macOS Native APIs NSAppleScript or OSAScript, both of which execute code independent of the /usr/bin/osascript command line utility."
T1059,"Adversaries may abuse AppleScript to execute various behaviors, such as interacting with an open SSH connection, moving to remote machines, and even presenting users with fake dialog boxes."
T1059,"These events cannot start applications remotely , but they can interact with applications if they're already running remotely."
T1059,"On macOS 10.10 Yosemite and higher, AppleScript has the ability to execute Native APIs, which otherwise would require compilation and execution in a mach-O binary file format.."
T1059,"Since this is a scripting language, it can be used to launch more common techniques as well such as a reverse shell via Python."
T1059,Dok uses AppleScript to create a login item for persistence.
T1059,Bundlore can use AppleScript to inject malicious JavaScript into a browser.
T1059,ThiefQuest uses AppleScript's osascript -e command to launch ThiefQuest's persistence via Launch Agent and Launch Daemon.
T1550,"Adversaries may use stolen application access tokens to bypass the typical authentication process and access restricted accounts, information, or services on remote systems."
T1550,These tokens are typically stolen from users and used in lieu of login credentials.
T1550,Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud-based applications and software-as-a-service .
T1550,OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems.
T1550,These frameworks are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the user is allowed to perform.
T1550,"Once identity is established, the token allows actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user."
T1550,"Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources of other sites through a malicious application."
T1550,"For example, with a cloud-based email service once an OAuth access token is granted to a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features of the user account if a ""refresh"" token enabling background access is awarded."
T1550,With an OAuth access token an adversary can use the user-granted REST API to perform functions such as email searching and contact enumeration.
T1550,Compromised access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services.
T1550,"For example, if a token grants access to a victim’s primary email, the adversary may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes by triggering forgotten password routines."
T1550,Direct API access through a token negates the effectiveness of a second authentication factor and may be immune to intuitive countermeasures like changing passwords.
T1550,"Access abuse over an API channel can be difficult to detect even from the service provider end, as the access can still align well with a legitimate workflow."
T1550,"APT28 has used several malicious applications that abused OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts, including Gmail and Yahoo Mail."
T1499,Adversaries may target resource intensive features of web applications to cause a denial of service .
T1499,Specific features in web applications may be highly resource intensive.
T1499,Repeated requests to those features may be able to exhaust system resources and deny access to the application or the server itself.
T1071,Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic.
T1071,"Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server."
T1071,"Adversaries may utilize many different protocols, including those used for web browsing, transferring files, electronic mail, or DNS."
T1071,"For connections that occur internally within an enclave , commonly used protocols are SMB, SSH, or RDP."
T1071,"Duqu uses a custom command and control protocol that communicates over commonly used ports, and is frequently encapsulated by application layer protocols."
T1071,Adversaries can also use NETEAGLE to establish an RDP connection with a controller over TCP/7519.
T1071,"The Regin malware platform supports many standard protocols, including SMB."
T1071,Cobalt Strike can conduct peer-to-peer communication over Windows named pipes encapsulated in the SMB protocol.
T1071,All protocols use their standard assigned ports.
T1071,Lucifer can use the Stratum protocol on port 10001 for communication between the cryptojacking bot and the mining server.
T1071,Hildegard has used an IRC channel for C2 communications.
T1071,Siloscape connects to an IRC server for C2.

T1071,Rocke issued wget requests from infected systems to the C2.
T1071,TeamTNT has used an IRC bot for C2 communications.
T1071,APT34 malware often uses HTTP and DNS for C2.
T1071,The group has also used the Plink utility and other tools to create tunnels to C2 servers.
T1546,Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by application shims.
T1546,The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure/Framework  was created to allow for backward compatibility of software as the operating system codebase changes over time.
T1546,"For example, the application shimming feature allows developers to apply fixes to applications  that were created for Windows XP so that it will work with Windows 10."
T1546,"Within the framework, shims are created to act as a buffer between the program  and the Windows OS."
T1546,"When a program is executed, the shim cache is referenced to determine if the program requires the use of the shim database ."
T1546,"If so, the shim database uses hooking to redirect the code as necessary in order to communicate with the OS."
T1546,"A list of all shims currently installed by the default Windows installer  is kept in:
* %WINDIR%\AppPatch\sysmain.sdb and
* hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\appcompatflags\installedsdb
Custom databases are stored in:
* %WINDIR%\AppPatch\custom & %WINDIR%\AppPatch\AppPatch64\Custom and
* hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\appcompatflags\custom
To keep shims secure, Windows designed them to run in user mode so they cannot modify the kernel and you must have administrator privileges to install a shim."
T1546,"However, certain shims can be used to Bypass User Account Control , inject DLLs into processes , disable Data Execution Prevention  and Structure Exception Handling , and intercept memory addresses ."
T1546,"Utilizing these shims may allow an adversary to perform several malicious acts such as elevate privileges, install backdoors, disable defenses like Windows Defender, etc."
T1546,Shims can also be abused to establish persistence by continuously being invoked by affected programs.
T1546,ShimRat has installed shim databases in the AppPatch folder.
T1546,"SDBbot has the ability to use application shimming for persistence if it detects it is running as admin on Windows XP or 7, by creating a shim database to patch services.exe."
T1546,Pillowmint has used a malicious shim database to maintain persistence.
T1546,FIN7 has used application shim databases for persistence.

T1027,Adversaries may use binary padding to add junk data and change the on-disk representation of malware.
T1027,"This can be done without affecting the functionality or behavior of a binary, but can increase the size of the binary beyond what some security tools are capable of handling due to file size limitations."
T1027,Binary padding effectively changes the checksum of the file and can also be used to avoid hash-based blocklists and static anti-virus signatures.
T1027,The padding used is commonly generated by a function to create junk data and then appended to the end or applied to sections of malware.
T1027,Increasing the file size may decrease the effectiveness of certain tools and detection capabilities that are not designed or configured to scan large files.
T1027,This may also reduce the likelihood of being collected for analysis.
T1027,"Public file scanning services, such as VirusTotal, limits the maximum size of an uploaded file to be analyzed."
T1027,"yty contains junk code in its binary, likely to confuse malware analysts."

T1547,LoudMiner can automatically launch at startup if the AutoStart option is enabled in the VBoxVmService configuration file.
T1037,Adversaries may use scripts automatically executed at boot or logon initialization to establish persistence.
T1037,"Initialization scripts can be used to perform administrative functions, which may often execute other programs or send information to an internal logging server."
T1037,These scripts can vary based on operating system and whether applied locally or remotely.
T1037,Adversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a single system.
T1037,"Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary."
T1037,An adversary may also be able to escalate their privileges since some boot or logon initialization scripts run with higher privileges.
T1037,"Rocke has installed an ""init.d"" startup script to maintain persistence."
T1542,Adversaries may use bootkits to persist on systems.
T1542,Bootkits reside at a layer below the operating system and may make it difficult to perform full remediation unless an organization suspects one was used and can act accordingly.
T1542,"A bootkit is a malware variant that modifies the boot sectors of a hard drive, including the Master Boot Record  and Volume Boot Record ."
T1542,The MBR is the section of disk that is first loaded after completing hardware initialization by the BIOS.
T1542,It is the location of the boot loader.
T1542,"An adversary who has raw access to the boot drive may overwrite this area, diverting execution during startup from the normal boot loader to adversary code."
T1542,The MBR passes control of the boot process to the VBR.
T1542,"Similar to the case of MBR, an adversary who has raw access to the boot drive may overwrite the VBR to divert execution during startup to adversary code."
T1542,BOOTRASH is a Volume Boot Record  bootkit that uses the VBR to maintain persistence.
T1542,ROCKBOOT is a Master Boot Record  bootkit that uses the MBR to establish persistence.

T1583,"Adversaries may buy, lease, or rent a network of compromised systems that can be used during targeting."
T1583,A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed to perform coordinated tasks.
T1583,Adversaries may purchase a subscription to use an existing botnet from a booter/stresser service.
T1583,"With a botnet at their disposal, adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale Phishing or Distributed Denial of Service ."
T1584,Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnet that can be used during targeting.
T1584,"Instead of purchasing/renting a botnet from a booter/stresser service, adversaries may build their own botnet by compromising numerous third-party systems."
T1584,"Adversaries may also conduct a takeover of an existing botnet, such as redirecting bots to adversary-controlled C2 servers."
T1217,Adversaries may enumerate browser bookmarks to learn more about compromised hosts.
T1217,"Browser bookmarks may reveal personal information about users  as well as details about internal network resources such as servers, tools/dashboards, or other related infrastructure."
T1217,"Browser bookmarks may also highlight additional targets after an adversary has access to valid credentials, especially Credentials In Files associated with logins cached by a browser."
T1217,"Specific storage locations vary based on platform and/or application, but browser bookmarks are typically stored in local files/databases."

T1217,"APT38 has collected browser bookmark information to learn more about compromised hosts, obtain personal information about users, and acquire details about internal network resources."
T1176,Adversaries may abuse Internet browser extensions to establish persistent access to victim systems.
T1176,Browser extensions or plugins are small programs that can add functionality and customize aspects of Internet browsers.
T1176,They can be installed directly or through a browser's app store and generally have access and permissions to everything that the browser can access.
T1176,"Malicious extensions can be installed into a browser through malicious app store downloads masquerading as legitimate extensions, through social engineering, or by an adversary that has already compromised a system."
T1176,Security can be limited on browser app stores so it may not be difficult for malicious extensions to defeat automated scanners.
T1176,"Depending on the browser, adversaries may also manipulate an extension's update url to install updates from an adversary controlled server or manipulate the mobile configuration file to silently install additional extensions."
T1176,"Previous to macOS 11, adversaries could silently install browser extensions via the command line using the profiles tool to install malicious .mobileconfig files."
T1176,"In macOS 11+, the use of the profiles tool can no longer install configuration profiles, however .mobileconfig files can be planted and installed with user interaction."
T1176,"Once the extension is installed, it can browse to websites in the background, steal all information that a user enters into a browser  and be used as an installer for a RAT for persistence."
T1176,There have also been instances of botnets using a persistent backdoor through malicious Chrome extensions.
T1176,There have also been similar examples of extensions being used for command & control.
T1176,OSX/Shlayer can install malicious Safari browser extensions to serve ads.
T1176,Bundlore can install malicious browser extensions that are used to hijack user searches.
T1176,Grandoreiro can use malicious browser extensions to steal cookies and other user information.
T1176,Stolen Pencil victims are prompted to install malicious Google Chrome extensions which gave the threat actor the ability to read data from any website accessed.
T1176,Kimsuky has used Google Chrome browser extensions to infect victims and to steal passwords and cookies.
T1185,"Adversaries may take advantage of security vulnerabilities and inherent functionality in browser software to change content, modify user-behaviors, and intercept information as part of various browser session hijacking techniques."
T1185,"A specific example is when an adversary injects software into a browser that allows them to inherit cookies, HTTP sessions, and SSL client certificates of a user then use the browser as a way to pivot into an authenticated intranet."
T1185,"Executing browser-based behaviors such as pivoting may require specific process permissions, such as SeDebugPrivilege and/or high-integrity/administrator rights."
T1185,Another example involves pivoting browser traffic from the adversary's browser through the user's browser by setting up a proxy which will redirect web traffic.
T1185,"This does not alter the user's traffic in any way, and the proxy connection can be severed as soon as the browser is closed."
T1185,The adversary assumes the security context of whichever browser process the proxy is injected into.
T1185,Browsers typically create a new process for each tab that is opened and permissions and certificates are separated accordingly.
T1185,"With these permissions, an adversary could potentially browse to any resource on an intranet, such as Sharepoint or webmail, that is accessible through the browser and which the browser has sufficient permissions."
T1185,Browser pivoting may also bypass security provided by 2-factor authentication.
T1185,TrickBot uses web injects and browser redirection to trick the user into providing their login credentials on a fake or modified web page.

T1185,QakBot can use advanced web injects to steal web banking credentials.
T1185,Chaes has used the Puppeteer module to hook and monitor the Chrome web browser to collect user information from infected hosts.
T1110,Adversaries may use brute force techniques to gain access to accounts when passwords are unknown or when password hashes are obtained.
T1110,"Without knowledge of the password for an account or set of accounts, an adversary may systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism."
T1110,"Brute forcing passwords can take place via interaction with a service that will check the validity of those credentials or offline against previously acquired credential data, such as password hashes."
T1110,Brute forcing credentials may take place at various points during a breach.
T1110,"For example, adversaries may attempt to brute force access to Valid Accounts within a victim environment leveraging knowledge gathered from other post-compromise behaviors such as OS Credential Dumping, Account Discovery, or Password Policy Discovery."
T1110,Adversaries may also combine brute forcing activity with behaviors such as External Remote Services as part of Initial Access.

T1110,"Dragonfly dropped and executed Hydra, a password cracker."
T1612,Adversaries may build a container image directly on a host to bypass defenses that monitor for the retrieval of malicious images from a public registry.
T1612,"A remote build request may be sent to the Docker API that includes a Dockerfile that pulls a vanilla base image, such as alpine, from a public or local registry and then builds a custom image upon it."
T1612,"An adversary may take advantage of that build API to build a custom image on the host that includes malware downloaded from their C2 server, and then they then may utilize Deploy Container using that custom image."
T1612,"If the base image is pulled from a public registry, defenses will likely not detect the image as malicious since it’s a vanilla image."
T1612,"If the base image already resides in a local registry, the pull may be considered even less suspicious since the image is already in the environment."
T1591,Adversaries may gather information about the victim's business relationships that can be used during targeting.
T1591,"Information about an organization’s business relationships may include a variety of details, including second or third-party organizations/domains  that have connected  network access."
T1591,This information may also reveal supply chains and shipment paths for the victim’s hardware and software resources.
T1591,"Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via Phishing for Information."
T1591,Information about business relationships may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets  or Search Victim-Owned Websites.
T1591,"Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance  or Search Open Websites/Domains, establishing operational resources  or Compromise Accounts, and/or initial access , Drive-by Compromise, or Trusted Relationship."
T1591,"In preparation for its attack against the 2018 Winter Olympics, Sandworm Team conducted online research of partner organizations listed on an official PyeongChang Olympics partnership site."
T1548,Adversaries may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges on system.
T1548,"Windows User Account Control  allows a program to elevate its privileges  to perform a task under administrator-level permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation."
T1548,The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action.
T1548,"If the UAC protection level of a computer is set to anything but the highest level, certain Windows programs can elevate privileges or execute some elevated Component Object Model objects without prompting the user through the UAC notification box."
T1548,An example of this is use of Rundll32 to load a specifically crafted DLL which loads an auto-elevated Component Object Model object and performs a file operation in a protected directory which would typically require elevated access.
T1548,Malicious software may also be injected into a trusted process to gain elevated privileges without prompting a user.
T1548,Many methods have been discovered to bypass UAC.
T1548,"The Github readme page for UACME contains an extensive list of methods that have been discovered and implemented, but may not be a comprehensive list of bypasses."
T1548,"Additional bypass methods are regularly discovered and some used in the wild, such as:
* eventvwr.exe can auto-elevate and execute a specified binary or script."
T1548,"Another bypass is possible through some lateral movement techniques if credentials for an account with administrator privileges are known, since UAC is a single system security mechanism, and the privilege or integrity of a process running on one system will be unknown on remote systems and default to high integrity."

T1574,Adversaries may leverage the COR_PROFILER environment variable to hijack the execution flow of programs that load the .NET CLR.
T1574,The COR_PROFILER is a .NET Framework feature which allows developers to specify an unmanaged  profiling DLL to be loaded into each .NET process that loads the Common Language Runtime .
T1574,"These profilers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and debug managed code executed by the .NET CLR."
T1574,The COR_PROFILER environment variable can be set at various scopes  resulting in different levels of influence.
T1574,"System and user-wide environment variable scopes are specified in the Registry, where a Component Object Model  object can be registered as a profiler DLL."
T1574,A process scope COR_PROFILER can also be created in-memory without modifying the Registry.
T1574,"Starting with .NET Framework 4, the profiling DLL does not need to be registered as long as the location of the DLL is specified in the COR_PROFILER_PATH environment variable."
T1574,Adversaries may abuse COR_PROFILER to establish persistence that executes a malicious DLL in the context of all .NET processes every time the CLR is invoked.
T1574,"The COR_PROFILER can also be used to elevate privileges  if the victim .NET process executes at a higher permission level, as well as to hook and Impair Defenses provided by .NET processes."

T1546,Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by a file type association.
T1546,"When a file is opened, the default program used to open the file  is checked."
T1546,"File association selections are stored in the Windows Registry and can be edited by users, administrators, or programs that have Registry access   or by administrators using the built-in assoc utility."
T1546,Applications can modify the file association for a given file extension to call an arbitrary program when a file with the given extension is opened.
T1546,"System file associations are listed under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.extension, for example HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.txt."
T1546,The entries point to a handler for that extension located at HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\handler.
T1546,The various commands are then listed as subkeys underneath the shell key at HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\handler\shell\action\command.
T1546,"For example: 
* HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile\shell\open\command
* HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile\shell\print\command
* HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\txtfile\shell\printto\command
The values of the keys listed are commands that are executed when the handler opens the file extension."

T1070,"On Linux and macOS, these command histories can be accessed in a few different ways."
T1070,"While logged in, this command history is tracked in a file pointed to by the environment variable HISTFILE."
T1070,"When a user logs off a system, this information is flushed to a file in the user's home directory called ~/.bash_history."
T1070,The benefit of this is that it allows users to go back to commands they've used before in different sessions.
T1070,Adversaries may delete their commands from these logs by manually clearing the history  or deleting the bash history file rm ~/.bash_history.
T1070,"On Windows hosts, PowerShell has two different command history providers: the built-in history and the command history managed by the PSReadLine module."
T1070,The built-in history only tracks the commands used in the current session.
T1070,This command history is not available to other sessions and is deleted when the session ends.
T1070,The PSReadLine command history tracks the commands used in all PowerShell sessions and writes them to a file .
T1070,This history file is available to all sessions and contains all past history since the file is not deleted when the session ends.
T1070,Adversaries may run the PowerShell command Clear-History to flush the entire command history from a current PowerShell session.

T1136,Adversaries may create a cloud account to maintain access to victim systems.
T1136,"With a sufficient level of access, such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that does not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system."
T1136,"Adversaries may create accounts that only have access to specific cloud services, which can reduce the chance of detection."
T1087,Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of cloud accounts.
T1087,"Cloud accounts are those created and configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application."
T1087,With authenticated access there are several tools that can be used to find accounts.
T1087,The Get-MsolRoleMember PowerShell cmdlet can be used to obtain account names given a role or permissions group in Office 365.

T1078,APT33 has used compromised Office 365 accounts in tandem with Ruler in an attempt to gain control of endpoints.
T1078,APT28 has used compromised Office 365 service accounts with Global Administrator privileges to collect email from user inboxes.
T1069,Adversaries may attempt to find cloud groups and permission settings.
T1069,"The knowledge of cloud permission groups can help adversaries determine the particular roles of users and groups within an environment, as well as which users are associated with a particular group."
T1069,With authenticated access there are several tools that can be used to find permissions groups.
T1069,The Get-MsolRole PowerShell cmdlet can be used to obtain roles and permissions groups for Exchange and Office 365 accounts .
T1069,Azure CLI  and the Google Cloud Identity Provider API also provide interfaces to obtain permissions groups.
T1069,The command az ad user get-member-groups will list groups associated to a user account for Azure while the API endpoint GET https://cloudidentity.googleapis.com/v1/groups lists group resources available to a user for Google .
T1069,"Adversaries may attempt to list ACLs for objects to determine the owner and other accounts with access to the object, for example, via the AWS GetBucketAcl API ."
T1069,Using this information an adversary can target accounts with permissions to a given object or leverage accounts they have already compromised to access the object.
T1580,An adversary may attempt to discover resources that are available within an infrastructure-as-a-service  environment.
T1580,"This includes compute service resources such as instances, virtual machines, and snapshots as well as resources of other services including the storage and database services."
T1580,Cloud providers offer methods such as APIs and commands issued through CLIs to serve information about infrastructure.
T1580,"For example, AWS provides a DescribeInstances API within the Amazon EC2 API that can return information about one or more instances within an account, the ListBuckets API that returns a list of all buckets owned by the authenticated sender of the request, or the GetPublicAccessBlock API to retrieve access block configuration for a bucket ."
T1580,"Similarly, GCP's Cloud SDK CLI provides the gcloud compute instances list command to list all Google Compute Engine instances in a project , and Azure's CLI command az vm list lists details of virtual machines."
T1580,An adversary may enumerate resources using a compromised user's access keys to determine which are available to that user.
T1580,"The discovery of these available resources may help adversaries determine their next steps in the Cloud environment, such as establishing Persistence.An adversary may also use this information to change the configuration to make the bucket publicly accessible, allowing data to be accessed without authentication."
T1580,"Adversaries have also may use infrastructure discovery APIs such as DescribeDBInstances to determine size, owner, permissions, and network ACLs of database resources."
T1580,Adversaries can use this information to determine the potential value of databases and discover the requirements to access them.
T1580,"Unlike in Cloud Service Discovery, this technique focuses on the discovery of components of the provided services rather than the services themselves."
T1552,Adversaries may attempt to access the Cloud Instance Metadata API to collect credentials and other sensitive data.
T1552,Most cloud service providers support a Cloud Instance Metadata API which is a service provided to running virtual instances that allows applications to access information about the running virtual instance.
T1552,"Available information generally includes name, security group, and additional metadata including sensitive data such as credentials and UserData scripts that may contain additional secrets."
T1552,The Instance Metadata API is provided as a convenience to assist in managing applications and is accessible by anyone who can access the instance.
T1552,A cloud metadata API has been used in at least one high profile compromise.
T1552,"If adversaries have a presence on the running virtual instance, they may query the Instance Metadata API directly to identify credentials that grant access to additional resources."
T1552,"Additionally, attackers may exploit a Server-Side Request Forgery  vulnerability in a public facing web proxy that allows the attacker to gain access to the sensitive information via a request to the Instance Metadata API."
T1552,The de facto standard across cloud service providers is to host the Instance Metadata API at http://169.254.169.254.
T1552,Hildegard has queried the Cloud Instance Metadata API for cloud credentials.
T1552,TeamTNT has queried the AWS instance metadata service for credentials.
T1538,"An adversary may use a cloud service dashboard GUI with stolen credentials to gain useful information from an operational cloud environment, such as specific services, resources, and features."
T1538,"For example, the GCP Command Center can be used to view all assets, findings of potential security risks, and to run additional queries, such as finding public IP addresses and open ports."
T1538,"Depending on the configuration of the environment, an adversary may be able to enumerate more information via the graphical dashboard than an API."
T1538,This allows the adversary to gain information without making any API requests.
T1526,An adversary may attempt to enumerate the cloud services running on a system after gaining access.
T1526,"These methods can differ from platform-as-a-service , to infrastructure-as-a-service , or software-as-a-service ."
T1526,"Many services exist throughout the various cloud providers and can include Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery , Lambda Functions, Azure AD, etc."
T1526,Adversaries may attempt to discover information about the services enabled throughout the environment.
T1526,"Azure tools and APIs, such as the Azure AD Graph API and Azure Resource Manager API, can enumerate resources and services, including applications, management groups, resources and policy definitions, and their relationships that are accessible by an identity."
T1526,"Stormspotter is an open source tool for enumerating and constructing a graph for Azure resources and services, and Pacu is an open source AWS exploitation framework that supports several methods for discovering cloud services."
T1619,Adversaries may enumerate objects in cloud storage infrastructure.
T1619,"Adversaries may use this information during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including requesting all or specific objects from cloud storage."
T1619,"Similar to File and Directory Discovery on a local host, after identifying available storage services  Cloud Infrastructure Discovery adversaries may access the contents/objects stored in cloud infrastructure."
T1619,Cloud service providers offer APIs allowing users to enumerate objects stored within cloud storage.
T1619,Examples include ListObjectsV2 in AWS  and List Blobs in Azure .
T1213,Adversaries may leverage code repositories to collect valuable information.
T1213,Code repositories are tools/services that store source code and automate software builds.
T1213,"They may be hosted internally or privately on third party sites such as Github, GitLab, SourceForge, and BitBucket."
T1213,Users typically interact with code repositories through a web application or command-line utilities such as git.
T1213,"Once adversaries gain access to a victim network or a private code repository, they may collect sensitive information such as proprietary source code or credentials contained within software's source code."
T1213,"Having access to software's source code may allow adversaries to develop Exploits, while credentials may provide access to additional resources using Valid Accounts."
T1213,APT29 has downloaded source code from code repositories.

T1092,Commands and files would be relayed from the disconnected system to the Internet-connected system to which the adversary has direct access.
T1092,"Part of APT28's operation involved using CHOPSTICK modules to copy itself to air-gapped machines, using files written to USB sticks to transfer data and command traffic."
T1092,"USBStealer drops commands for a second victim onto a removable media drive inserted into the first victim, and commands are executed when the drive is inserted into the second victim."
T1092,APT28 uses a tool that captures information from air-gapped computers via an infected USB and transfers it to network-connected computer when the USB is inserted.
T1027,Adversaries may attempt to make payloads difficult to discover and analyze by delivering files to victims as uncompiled code.
T1027,Text-based source code files may subvert analysis and scrutiny from protections targeting executables/binaries.
T1027,These payloads will need to be compiled before execution; typically via native utilities such as csc.exe or GCC/MinGW.
T1027,"Source code payloads may also be encrypted, encoded, and/or embedded within other files, such as those delivered as a Phishing."
T1027,Payloads may also be delivered in formats unrecognizable and inherently benign to the native OS  before later being compiled into a proper executable binary with a bundled compiler and execution framework.

T1542,Adversaries may modify component firmware to persist on systems.
T1542,Some adversaries may employ sophisticated means to compromise computer components and install malicious firmware that will execute adversary code outside of the operating system and main system firmware or BIOS.
T1542,This technique may be similar to System Firmware but conducted upon other system components/devices that may not have the same capability or level of integrity checking.
T1542,"Malicious component firmware could provide both a persistent level of access to systems despite potential typical failures to maintain access and hard disk re-images, as well as a way to evade host software-based defenses and integrity checks."
T1542,Equation is known to have the capability to overwrite the firmware on hard drives from some manufacturers.
T1559,Adversaries may use the Windows Component Object Model  for local code execution.
T1559,"COM is an inter-process communication  component of the native Windows application programming interface  that enables interaction between software objects, or executable code that implements one or more interfaces."
T1559,"Through COM, a client object can call methods of server objects, which are typically binary Dynamic Link Libraries  or executables ."
T1559,Remote COM execution is facilitated by Remote Services such as  Distributed Component Object Model .
T1559,"Various COM interfaces are exposed that can be abused to invoke arbitrary execution via a variety of programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Visual Basic."
T1559,"Specific COM objects also exist to directly perform functions beyond code execution, such as creating a Scheduled Task/Job, fileless download/execution, and other adversary behaviors related to privilege escalation and persistence."
T1559,POWERSTATS can use DCOM  to execute additional payloads on compromised hosts.
T1559,Ursnif droppers have used COM objects to execute the malware's full executable payload.

T1546,COM is a system within Windows to enable interaction between software components through the operating system.
T1546,References to various COM objects are stored in the Registry.
T1546,Adversaries can use the COM system to insert malicious code that can be executed in place of legitimate software through hijacking the COM references and relationships as a means for persistence.
T1546,Hijacking a COM object requires a change in the Registry to replace a reference to a legitimate system component which may cause that component to not work when executed.
T1546,When that system component is executed through normal system operation the adversary's code will be executed instead.
T1546,"An adversary is likely to hijack objects that are used frequently enough to maintain a consistent level of persistence, but are unlikely to break noticeable functionality within the system as to avoid system instability that could lead to detection."
T1546,Some variants of ADVSTORESHELL achieve persistence by registering the payload as a Shell Icon Overlay handler COM object.
T1546,JHUHUGIT has used COM hijacking to establish persistence by hijacking a class named MMDeviceEnumerator and also by registering the payload as a Shell Icon Overlay handler COM object .
T1546,ComRAT samples have been seen which hijack COM objects for persistence by replacing the path to shell32.dll in registry location HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID\{42aedc87-2188-41fd-b9a3-0c966feabec1}\InprocServer32.
T1546,Mosquito uses COM hijacking as a method of persistence.
T1546,BBSRAT has been seen persisting via COM hijacking through replacement of the COM object for MruPidlList {42aedc87-2188-41fd-b9a3-0c966feabec1} or Microsoft WBEM New Event Subsystem {F3130CDB-AA52-4C3A-AB32-85FFC23AF9C1} depending on the system's CPU architecture.
T1546,KONNI has modified ComSysApp service to load the malicious DLL payload.
T1546,APT28 has used COM hijacking for persistence by replacing the legitimate MMDeviceEnumerator object with a payload.
T1586,Adversaries may compromise accounts with services that can be used during targeting.
T1586,"For operations incorporating social engineering, the utilization of an online persona may be important."
T1586,"Rather than creating and cultivating accounts  Establish Accounts, adversaries may compromise existing accounts."
T1586,"Utilizing an existing persona may engender a level of trust in a potential victim if they have a relationship, or knowledge of, the compromised persona."
T1586,"A variety of methods exist for compromising accounts, such as gathering credentials via Phishing for Information, purchasing credentials from third-party sites, or by brute forcing credentials ."
T1586,"Prior to compromising accounts, adversaries may conduct Reconnaissance to inform decisions about which accounts to compromise to further their operation."
T1586,Personas may exist on a single site or across multiple sites .
T1586,"Compromised accounts may require additional development, this could include filling out or modifying profile information, further developing social networks, or incorporating photos."
T1586,Adversaries may directly leverage compromised email accounts for Phishing for Information or Phishing.
T1554,Adversaries may modify client software binaries to establish persistent access to systems.
T1554,Client software enables users to access services provided by a server.
T1554,"Common client software types are SSH clients, FTP clients, email clients, and web browsers."
T1554,Adversaries may make modifications to client software binaries to carry out malicious tasks when those applications are in use.
T1554,"For example, an adversary may copy source code for the client software, add a backdoor, compile for the target, and replace the legitimate application binary  with the backdoored one."
T1554,"Since these applications may be routinely executed by the user, the adversary can leverage this for persistent access to the host."
T1554,Ebury has been embedded into modified OpenSSH binaries to gain persistent access to SSH credential information.
T1554,Bonadan has maliciously altered the OpenSSH binary on targeted systems to create a backdoor.

T1195,"By modifying hardware or firmware in the supply chain, adversaries can insert a backdoor into consumer networks that may be difficult to detect and give the adversary a high degree of control over the system."
T1195,"Hardware backdoors may be inserted into various devices, such as servers, workstations, network infrastructure, or peripherals."
T1584,Adversaries may compromise third-party infrastructure that can be used during targeting.
T1584,"Instead of buying, leasing, or renting infrastructure an adversary may compromise infrastructure and use it during other phases of the adversary lifecycle."
T1584,"Additionally, adversaries may compromise numerous machines to form a botnet they can leverage."
T1584,"Use of compromised infrastructure allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation."
T1584,"Compromised infrastructure can help adversary operations blend in with traffic that is seen as normal, such as contact with high reputation or trusted sites."
T1584,"By using compromised infrastructure, adversaries may make it difficult to tie their actions back to them."
T1584,"Prior to targeting, adversaries may compromise the infrastructure of other adversaries."
T1195,Adversaries may manipulate software dependencies and development tools prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise.
T1195,Applications often depend on external software to function properly.
T1195,Popular open source projects that are used as dependencies in many applications may be targeted as a means to add malicious code to users of the dependency.
T1195,Targeting may be specific to a desired victim set or may be distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to additional tactics on specific victims.
T1195,XCSSET adds malicious code to a host's Xcode projects by enumerating CocoaPods target_integrator.rb files under the /Library/Ruby/Gems folder or enumerates all .xcodeproj folders under a given directory.
T1195,XCSSET then downloads a script and Mach-O file into the Xcode project folder.
T1195,Adversaries may manipulate application software prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise.

T1195,APT29 gained initial network access to some victims via a trojanized update of SolarWinds Orion software.
T1213,Adversaries may leverage Confluence repositories to mine valuable information.
T1213,"Often found in development environments alongside Atlassian JIRA, Confluence is generally used to store development-related documentation, however, in general may contain more diverse categories of useful information, such as:
* Policies, procedures, and standards
* Physical / logical network diagrams
* System architecture diagrams
* Technical system documentation
* Testing / development credentials
* Work / project schedules
* Source code snippets
* Links to network shares and other internal resources"
T1552,Adversaries may gather credentials via APIs within a containers environment.
T1552,"APIs in these environments, such as the Docker API and Kubernetes APIs, allow a user to remotely manage their container resources and cluster components."
T1552,"An adversary may access the Docker API to collect logs that contain credentials to cloud, container, and various other resources in the environment."
T1552,"An adversary with sufficient permissions, such as via a pod's service account, may also use the Kubernetes API to retrieve credentials from the Kubernetes API server."
T1552,These credentials may include those needed for Docker API authentication or secrets from Kubernetes cluster components.
T1609,Adversaries may abuse a container administration service to execute commands within a container.
T1609,"A container administration service such as the Docker daemon, the Kubernetes API server, or the kubelet may allow remote management of containers within an environment."
T1609,"In Docker, adversaries may specify an entrypoint during container deployment that executes a script or command, or they may use a command such as docker exec to execute a command within a running container."
T1609,"In Kubernetes, if an adversary has sufficient permissions, they may gain remote execution in a container in the cluster via interaction with the Kubernetes API server, the kubelet, or by running a command such as kubectl exec."
T1609,Kinsing was executed with an Ubuntu container entry point that runs shell scripts.
T1609,Hildegard was executed through the kubelet API run command and by executing commands on running containers.
T1609,Siloscape can send kubectl commands to victim clusters through an IRC channel and can run kubectl locally to spread once within a victim cluster.
T1609,TeamTNT executed Hildegard through the kubelet API run command and by executing commands on running containers.
T1053,Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality provided by container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes to schedule deployment of containers configured to execute malicious code.
T1053,"Container orchestration jobs run these automated tasks at a specific date and time, similar to cron jobs on a Linux system."
T1053,"Deployments of this type can also be configured to maintain a quantity of containers over time, automating the process of maintaining persistence within a cluster."
T1053,"In Kubernetes, a CronJob may be used to schedule a Job that runs one or more containers to perform specific tasks."
T1053,An adversary therefore may utilize a CronJob to schedule deployment of a Job that executes malicious code in various nodes within a cluster.
T1613,Adversaries may attempt to discover containers and other resources that are available within a containers environment.
T1613,"Other resources may include images, deployments, pods, nodes, and other information such as the status of a cluster."
T1613,These resources can be viewed within web applications such as the Kubernetes dashboard or can be queried via the Docker and Kubernetes APIs.
T1613,"In Docker, logs may leak information about the environment, such as the environment’s configuration, which services are available, and what cloud provider the victim may be utilizing."
T1613,"The discovery of these resources may inform an adversary’s next steps in the environment, such as how to perform lateral movement and which methods to utilize for execution."
T1613,Hildegard has used masscan to search for kubelets and the kubelet API for additional running containers.
T1613,TeamTNT has checked for running containers with docker ps and for specific container names with docker inspect.
T1218,Adversaries may abuse control.exe to proxy execution of malicious payloads.
T1218,"The Windows Control Panel process binary  handles execution of Control Panel items, which are utilities that allow users to view and adjust computer settings."
T1218,"Control Panel items are registered executable  or Control Panel  files, the latter are actually renamed dynamic-link library  files that export a CPlApplet function."
T1218,"For ease of use, Control Panel items typically include graphical menus available to users after being registered and loaded into the Control Panel."
T1218,"Control Panel items can be executed directly from the command line, programmatically via an application programming interface  call, or by simply double-clicking the file."
T1218,Malicious Control Panel items can be delivered via Phishing campaigns or executed as part of multi-stage malware.
T1218,"Control Panel items, specifically CPL files, may also bypass application and/or file extension allow lists."
T1218,Adversaries may also rename malicious DLL files  with Control Panel file extensions  and register them to HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Control Panel\Cpls.
T1218,"Even when these registered DLLs do not comply with the CPL file specification and do not export CPlApplet functions, they are loaded and executed through its DllEntryPoint when Control Panel is executed."
T1218,CPL files not exporting CPlApplet are not directly executable.
T1218,Reaver drops and executes a malicious CPL file as its payload.
T1218,InvisiMole can register itself for execution and persistence via the Control Panel.
T1136,Adversaries may create an account to maintain access to victim systems.
T1136,"With a sufficient level of access, creating such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system."
T1136,Accounts may be created on the local system or within a domain or cloud tenant.
T1136,"In cloud environments, adversaries may create accounts that only have access to specific services, which can reduce the chance of detection."
T1136,Indrik Spider used wmic.exe to add a new user to the system.
T1136,Sandworm Team added a login to a SQL Server with sp_addlinkedsrvlogin.
T1136,Dragonfly created accounts that appeared to be tailored to each individual staging target.
T1578,An adversary may create a new instance or virtual machine  within the compute service of a cloud account to evade defenses.
T1578,Creating a new instance may allow an adversary to bypass firewall rules and permissions that exist on instances currently residing within an account.
T1578,"An adversary may Create Snapshot of one or more volumes in an account, create a new instance, mount the snapshots, and then apply a less restrictive security policy to collect Data from Local System or for Remote Data Staging."
T1578,Creating a new instance may also allow an adversary to carry out malicious activity within an environment without affecting the execution of current running instances.
T1134,Adversaries may create a new process with a different token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls.

T1574,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load DLLs.
T1574,Windows systems use a common method to look for required DLLs to load into a program.
T1574,Hijacking DLL loads may be for the purpose of establishing persistence as well as elevating privileges and/or evading restrictions on file execution.
T1574,There are many ways an adversary can hijack DLL loads.
T1574,"Adversaries may plant trojan dynamic-link library files  in a directory that will be searched before the location of a legitimate library that will be requested by a program, causing Windows to load their malicious library when it is called for by the victim program."
T1574,"Adversaries may also perform DLL preloading, also called binary planting attacks,  by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as an ambiguously specified DLL in a location that Windows searches before the legitimate DLL."
T1574,Often this location is the current working directory of the program.
T1574,Remote DLL preloading attacks occur when a program sets its current directory to a remote location such as a Web share before loading a DLL.
T1574,"Adversaries may also directly modify the search order via DLL redirection, which after being enabled  may cause a program to load a different DLL."
T1574,"If a search order-vulnerable program is configured to run at a higher privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also be executed at the higher level."
T1574,"In this case, the technique could be used for privilege escalation from user to administrator or SYSTEM or from administrator to SYSTEM, depending on the program."
T1574,Programs that fall victim to path hijacking may appear to behave normally because malicious DLLs may be configured to also load the legitimate DLLs they were meant to replace.

T1574,BackdoorDiplomacy has executed DLL search order hijacking.
T1574,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading DLLs.
T1574,"Similar to DLL Search Order Hijacking, side-loading involves hijacking which DLL a program loads."
T1574,"But rather than just planting the DLL within the search order of a program then waiting for the victim application to be invoked, adversaries may directly side-load their payloads by planting then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload."
T1574,Side-loading takes advantage of the DLL search order used by the loader by positioning both the victim application and malicious payload alongside each other.
T1574,"Adversaries likely use side-loading as a means of masking actions they perform under a legitimate, trusted, and potentially elevated system or software process."
T1574,Benign executables used to side-load payloads may not be flagged during delivery and/or execution.
T1574,Adversary payloads may also be encrypted/packed or otherwise obfuscated until loaded into the memory of the trusted process.

T1562,"Security audit policy settings can be changed by running secpol.msc, then navigating to Security Settings\Local Policies\Audit Policy for basic audit policy settings or Security Settings\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration for advanced audit policy settings."
T1562,auditpol.exe may also be used to set audit policies.
T1562,Adversaries may target system-wide logging or just that of a particular application.
T1562,"For example, the EventLog service may be disabled using the following PowerShell line: Stop-Service -Name EventLog."
T1562,"Additionally, adversaries may use auditpol and its sub-commands in a command prompt to disable auditing or clear the audit policy."
T1562,"To enable or disable a specified setting or audit category, adversaries may use the /success or /failure parameters."
T1562,"For example, auditpol /set /category:”Account Logon” /success:disable /failure:disable turns off auditing for the Account Logon category."
T1562,"To clear the audit policy, adversaries may run the following lines: auditpol /clear /y or auditpol /remove /allusers."

T1556,Chimera's malware has altered the NTLM authentication program on domain controllers to allow Chimera to login without a valid credential.
T1090,Adversaries may take advantage of routing schemes in Content Delivery Networks  and other services which host multiple domains to obfuscate the intended destination of HTTPS traffic or traffic tunneled through HTTPS.
T1090,Domain fronting involves using different domain names in the SNI field of the TLS header and the Host field of the HTTP header.
T1090,"If both domains are served from the same CDN, then the CDN may route to the address specified in the HTTP header after unwrapping the TLS header."
T1090,"A variation of the the technique, ""domainless"" fronting, utilizes a SNI field that is left blank; this may allow the fronting to work even when the CDN attempts to validate that the SNI and HTTP Host fields match ."
T1090,"For example, if domain-x and domain-y are customers of the same CDN, it is possible to place domain-x in the TLS header and domain-y in the HTTP header."
T1090,"Traffic will appear to be going to domain-x, however the CDN may route it to domain-y."

T1090,SMOKEDHAM has used a fronted domain to obfuscate its hard-coded C2 server domain.
T1090,APT29 has used the meek domain fronting plugin for Tor to hide the destination of C2 traffic.
T1568,Adversaries may make use of Domain Generation Algorithms  to dynamically identify a destination domain for command and control traffic rather than relying on a list of static IP addresses or domains.
T1568,"This has the advantage of making it much harder for defenders block, track, or take over the command and control channel, as there potentially could be thousands of domains that malware can check for instructions."
T1568,DGAs can take the form of apparently random or “gibberish” strings  when they construct domain names by generating each letter.
T1568,"Alternatively, some DGAs employ whole words as the unit by concatenating words together instead of letters ."
T1568,"Many DGAs are time-based, generating a different domain for each time period ."
T1568,Others incorporate a seed value as well to make predicting future domains more difficult for defenders.
T1568,Adversaries may use DGAs for the purpose of Fallback Channels.
T1568,When contact is lost with the primary command and control server malware may employ a DGA as a means to reestablishing command and control.
T1568,CCBkdr can use a DGA for Fallback Channels if communications with the primary command and control server are lost.

T1069,Adversaries may attempt to find domain-level groups and permission settings.
T1069,The knowledge of domain-level permission groups can help adversaries determine which groups exist and which users belong to a particular group.
T1069,"Adversaries may use this information to determine which users have elevated permissions, such as domain administrators."
T1069,"Commands such as net group /domain of the Net utility,  dscacheutil -q group on macOS, and ldapsearch on Linux can list domain-level groups."

T1484,Adversaries may modify the configuration settings of a domain to evade defenses and/or escalate privileges in domain environments.
T1484,"Domains provide a centralized means of managing how computer resources  can act, and interact with each other, on a network."
T1484,The policy of the domain also includes configuration settings that may apply between domains in a multi-domain/forest environment.
T1484,"Modifications to domain settings may include altering domain Group Policy Objects  or changing trust settings for domains, including federation trusts."
T1484,"With sufficient permissions, adversaries can modify domain policy settings."
T1484,"Since domain configuration settings control many of the interactions within the Active Directory  environment, there are a great number of potential attacks that can stem from this abuse."
T1484,Examples of such abuse include modifying GPOs to push a malicious Scheduled Task to computers throughout the domain environment or modifying domain trusts to include an adversary controlled domain where they can control access tokens that will subsequently be accepted by victim domain resources.
T1484,Adversaries can also change configuration settings within the AD environment to implement a Rogue Domain Controller.
T1484,"Adversaries may temporarily modify domain policy, carry out a malicious action, and then revert the change to remove suspicious indicators."
T1590,Adversaries may gather information about the victim's network domain that can be used during targeting.
T1590,"Information about domains and their properties may include a variety of details, including what domain the victim owns as well as administrative data  and more directly actionable information such as contacts , business addresses, and name servers."
T1590,"Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via Active Scanning or Phishing for Information."
T1590,Information about victim domains and their properties may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets .
T1590,"Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance , Search Open Websites/Domains, or Phishing for Information, establishing operational resources  or Compromise Infrastructure, and/or initial access ."
T1590,Sandworm Team conducted technical reconnaissance of the Parliament of Georgia's official internet domain prior to its 2019 attack.
T1482,Adversaries may attempt to gather information on domain trust relationships that may be used to identify lateral movement opportunities in Windows multi-domain/forest environments.
T1482,Domain trusts provide a mechanism for a domain to allow access to resources based on the authentication procedures of another domain.
T1482,Domain trusts allow the users of the trusted domain to access resources in the trusting domain.
T1482,"The information discovered may help the adversary conduct SID-History Injection, Pass the Ticket, and Kerberoasting."
T1482,"Domain trusts can be enumerated using the `DSEnumerateDomainTrusts` Win32 API call, .NET methods, and LDAP."
T1482,The Windows utility Nltest is known to be used by adversaries to enumerate domain trusts.

T1482,FIN8 has retrieved a list of trusted domains by using Nltest.exe /domain_trusts.
T1482,Wizard Spider has used AdFind.exe to collect information about Active Directory organizational units and trust objects.
T1484,Adversaries may add new domain trusts or modify the properties of existing domain trusts to evade defenses and/or elevate privileges.
T1484,"Domain trust details, such as whether or not a domain is federated, allow authentication and authorization properties to apply between domains for the purpose of accessing shared resources."
T1484,"These trust objects may include accounts, credentials, and other authentication material applied to servers, tokens, and domains."
T1484,Manipulating the domain trusts may allow an adversary to escalate privileges and/or evade defenses by modifying settings to add objects which they control.
T1484,"For example, this may be used to forge SAML Tokens, without the need to compromise the signing certificate to forge new credentials."
T1484,"Instead, an adversary can manipulate domain trusts to add their own signing certificate."
T1484,UNC2452 changed domain federation trust settings using Azure AD administrative permissions to configure the domain to accept authorization tokens signed by their own SAML signing certificate.
T1484,APT29 changed domain federation trust settings using Azure AD administrative permissions to configure the domain to accept authorization tokens signed by their own SAML signing certificate.
T1583,Adversaries may purchase domains that can be used during targeting.
T1583,Domain names are the human readable names used to represent one or more IP addresses.
T1583,"They can be purchased or, in some cases, acquired for free."
T1583,"Adversaries can use purchased domains for a variety of purposes, including for Phishing, Drive-by Compromise, and Command and Control."
T1583,"Adversaries may choose domains that are similar to legitimate domains, including through use of homoglyphs or use of a different top-level domain ."
T1583,Typosquatting may be used to aid in delivery of payloads via Drive-by Compromise.
T1583,Adversaries can also use internationalized domain names  to create visually similar lookalike domains for use in operations.
T1583,Domain registrars each maintain a publicly viewable database that displays contact information for every registered domain.
T1583,"Private WHOIS services display alternative information, such as their own company data, rather than the owner of the domain."
T1583,Adversaries may use such private WHOIS services to obscure information about who owns a purchased domain.
T1583,Adversaries may further interrupt efforts to track their infrastructure by using varied registration information and purchasing domains with different domain registrars.
T1583,"APT28 registered domains imitating NATO, OSCE security websites, Caucasus information resources and other organizations."
T1583,APT1 has registered hundreds of domains for use in operations.

T1583,"IndigoZebra has established domains, some of which were designed to look like official government domains, for their operations."
T1584,Adversaries may hijack domains and/or subdomains that can be used during targeting.
T1584,Domain registration hijacking is the act of changing the registration of a domain name without the permission of the original registrant.
T1584,An adversary may gain access to an email account for the person listed as the owner of the domain.
T1584,The adversary can then claim that they forgot their password in order to make changes to the domain registration.
T1584,Other possibilities include social engineering a domain registration help desk to gain access to an account or taking advantage of renewal process gaps.
T1584,Subdomain hijacking can occur when organizations have DNS entries that point to non-existent or deprovisioned resources.
T1584,"In such cases, an adversary may take control of a subdomain to conduct operations with the benefit of the trust associated with that domain."
T1584,APT1 hijacked FQDNs associated with legitimate websites hosted by hop points.
T1584,UNC2452 has compromised domains to use for C2.
T1584,APT29 has compromised domains to use for C2.
T1584,Magic Hound has used compromised domains to host links targeted to specific phishing victims.
T1584,Transparent Tribe has compromised domains for use in targeted malicious campaigns.
T1036,Adversaries may abuse a double extension in the filename as a means of masquerading the true file type.
T1036,A file name may include a secondary file type extension that may cause only the first extension to be displayed .
T1036,"However, the second extension is the true file type that determines how the file is opened and executed."
T1036,"The real file extension may be hidden by the operating system in the file browser , as well as in any software configured using or similar to the system’s policies."
T1036,Adversaries may abuse double extensions to attempt to conceal dangerous file types of payloads.
T1036,A very common usage involves tricking a user into opening what they think is a benign file type but is actually executable code.
T1036,Such files often pose as email attachments and allow an adversary to gain Initial Access into a user’s system via Spearphishing Attachment then User Execution.
T1036,"For example, an executable file attachment named Evil.txt.exe may display as Evil.txt to a user."
T1036,"The user may then view it as a benign text file and open it, inadvertently executing the hidden malware."
T1036,"Common file types, such as text files  and image files  are typically used as the first extension to appear benign."
T1036,"Executable extensions commonly regarded as dangerous, such as .exe, .lnk, .hta, and .scr, often appear as the second extension and true file type."
T1036,The Bazar loader has used dual-extension executable files such as PreviewReport.DOC.exe.
T1036,Mustang Panda has used an additional filename extension to hide the true file type.
T1562,"Adversaries may downgrade or use a version of system features that may be outdated, vulnerable, and/or does not support updated security controls such as logging."
T1562,"For example, PowerShell versions 5+ includes Script Block Logging  which can record executed script content."
T1562,"However, adversaries may attempt to execute a previous version of PowerShell that does not support SBL with the intent to Impair Defenses while running malicious scripts that may have otherwise been detected."
T1562,"Adversaries may downgrade and use less-secure versions of various features of a system, such as Command and Scripting Interpreters or even network protocols that can be abused to enable Adversary-in-the-Middle."
T1601,Adversaries may install an older version of the operating system of a network device to weaken security.
T1601,"Older operating system versions on network devices often have weaker encryption ciphers and, in general, fewer/less updated defensive features."
T1601,"On embedded devices, downgrading the version typically only requires replacing the operating system file in storage."
T1601,"With most embedded devices, this can be achieved by downloading a copy of the desired version of the operating system file and reconfiguring the device to boot from that file on next system restart."
T1601,The adversary could then restart the device to implement the change immediately or they could wait until the next time the system restarts.
T1601,Downgrading the system image to an older versions may allow an adversary to evade defenses by enabling behaviors such as Weaken Encryption.
T1601,"Downgrading of a system image can be done on its own, or it can be used in conjunction with Patch System Image."
T1189,Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing.
T1189,"With this technique, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation, but adversaries may also use compromised websites for non-exploitation behavior such as acquiring Application Access Token."
T1189,"Multiple ways of delivering exploit code to a browser exist, including:
* A legitimate website is compromised where adversaries have injected some form of malicious code such as JavaScript, iFrames, and cross-site scripting."
T1189,* Malicious ads are paid for and served through legitimate ad providers.
T1189,* Built-in web application interfaces are leveraged for the insertion of any other kind of object that can be used to display web content or contain a script that executes on the visiting client .
T1189,"Often the website used by an adversary is one visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest."
T1189,This kind of targeted attack is referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack.
T1189,There are several known examples of this occurring.
T1189,"Typical drive-by compromise process:
1."
T1189,A user visits a website that is used to host the adversary controlled content.
T1189,2.
T1189,"Scripts automatically execute, typically searching versions of the browser and plugins for a potentially vulnerable version."
T1189,* The user may be required to assist in this process by enabling scripting or active website components and ignoring warning dialog boxes.
T1189,3.
T1189,"Upon finding a vulnerable version, exploit code is delivered to the browser."
T1189,4.
T1189,"If exploitation is successful, then it will give the adversary code execution on the user's system unless other protections are in place."
T1189,* In some cases a second visit to the website after the initial scan is required before exploit code is delivered.
T1189,"Unlike Exploit Public-Facing Application, the focus of this technique is to exploit software on a client endpoint upon visiting a website."
T1189,This will commonly give an adversary access to systems on the internal network instead of external systems that may be in a DMZ.
T1189,"Adversaries may also use compromised websites to deliver a user to a malicious application designed to Steal Application Access Tokens, like OAuth tokens, to gain access to protected applications and information."
T1189,These malicious applications have been delivered through popups on legitimate websites.
T1189,"KARAE was distributed through torrent file-sharing websites to South Korean victims, using a YouTube video downloader application as a lure."
T1189,POORAIM has been delivered through compromised sites acting as watering holes.

T1189,"Transparent Tribe has used websites with malicious hyperlinks and iframes to infect targeted victims with Crimson, njRAT, and other malicious tools."
T1608,Adversaries may prepare an operational environment to infect systems that visit a website over the normal course of browsing.
T1608,"Endpoint systems may be compromised through browsing to adversary controlled sites, as in Drive-by Compromise."
T1608,"In such cases, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation , but adversaries may also set up websites for non-exploitation behavior such as Application Access Token."
T1608,"Prior to Drive-by Compromise, adversaries must stage resources needed to deliver that exploit to users who browse to an adversary controlled site."
T1608,Drive-by content can be staged on adversary controlled infrastructure that has been acquired  or previously compromised .
T1608,"Adversaries may upload or inject malicious web content, such as JavaScript, into websites."
T1608,"This may be done in a number of ways, including inserting malicious script into web pages or other user controllable web content such as forum posts."
T1608,Adversaries may also craft malicious web advertisements and purchase ad space on a website through legitimate ad providers.
T1608,"In addition to staging content to exploit a user's web browser, adversaries may also stage scripting content to profile the user's browser  to ensure it is vulnerable prior to attempting exploitation."
T1608,"Websites compromised by an adversary and used to stage a drive-by may be ones visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest."
T1608,Adversaries may purchase domains similar to legitimate domains  during acquisition of infrastructure  to help facilitate Drive-by Compromise.
T1608,Threat Group-3390 has embedded malicious code into websites to screen a potential victim's IP address and then exploit their browser if they are of interest.
T1608,"APT32 has stood up websites containing numerous articles and content scraped from the Internet to make them appear legitimate, but some of these pages include malicious JavaScript to profile the potential victim or infect them via a fake software update."
T1608,"Transparent Tribe has set up websites with malicious hyperlinks and iframes to infect targeted victims with Crimson, njRAT, and other malicious tools."
T1574,Adversaries may execute their own payloads by placing a malicious dynamic library  with an expected name in a path a victim application searches at runtime.
T1574,The dynamic loader will try to find the dylibs based on the sequential order of the search paths.
T1574,"Paths to dylibs may be prefixed with @rpath, which allows developers to use relative paths to specify an array of search paths used at runtime based on the location of the executable."
T1574,"Additionally, if weak linking is used, such as the LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB function, an application will still execute even if an expected dylib is not present."
T1574,Weak linking enables developers to run an application on multiple macOS versions as new APIs are added.
T1574,Adversaries may gain execution by inserting malicious dylibs with the name of the missing dylib in the identified path.
T1574,Dylibs are loaded into an application's address space allowing the malicious dylib to inherit the application's privilege level and resources.
T1574,"Based on the application, this could result in privilege escalation and uninhibited network access."
T1574,This method may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
T1559,Adversaries may use Windows Dynamic Data Exchange  to execute arbitrary commands.
T1559,DDE is a client-server protocol for one-time and/or continuous inter-process communication  between applications.
T1559,"Once a link is established, applications can autonomously exchange transactions consisting of strings, warm data links , hot data links , and requests for command execution."
T1559,"Object Linking and Embedding , or the ability to link data between documents, was originally implemented through DDE."
T1559,"Despite being superseded by Component Object Model, DDE may be enabled in Windows 10 and most of Microsoft Office 2016 via Registry keys."
T1559,"Microsoft Office documents can be poisoned with DDE commands  , directly or through embedded files , and used to deliver execution via Phishing campaigns or hosted Web content, avoiding the use of Visual Basic for Applications  macros."
T1559,DDE could also be leveraged by an adversary operating on a compromised machine who does not have direct access to a Command and Scripting Interpreter.
T1559,DDE execution can be invoked remotely via Remote Services such as Distributed Component Object Model .
T1559,GravityRAT has been delivered via Word documents using DDE for execution.
T1559,POWERSTATS can use DDE to execute additional payloads on compromised hosts.

T1574,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries.
T1574,"During the execution preparation phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths of shared libraries from environment variables and files, such as LD_PRELOAD on Linux or DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES on macOS."
T1574,"Libraries specified in environment variables are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function name."
T1574,"These variables are often used by developers to debug binaries without needing to recompile, deconflict mapped symbols, and implement custom functions without changing the original library."
T1574,"On Linux and macOS, hijacking dynamic linker variables may grant access to the victim process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges."
T1574,"Adversaries can set environment variables via the command line using the export command, setenv function, or putenv function."
T1574,Adversaries can also leverage Dynamic Linker Hijacking to export variables in a shell or set variables programmatically using higher level syntax such Python’s os.environ.
T1574,"On Linux, adversaries may set LD_PRELOAD to point to malicious libraries that match the name of legitimate libraries which are requested by a victim program, causing the operating system to load the adversary's malicious code upon execution of the victim program."

T1548,Adversaries may leverage the AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges API to escalate privileges by prompting the user for credentials.
T1548,"The purpose of this API is to give application developers an easy way to perform operations with root privileges, such as for application installation or updating."
T1548,This API does not validate that the program requesting root privileges comes from a reputable source or has been maliciously modified.
T1548,"Although this API is deprecated, it still fully functions in the latest releases of macOS."
T1548,"When calling this API, the user will be prompted to enter their credentials but no checks on the origin or integrity of the program are made."
T1548,The program calling the API may also load world writable files which can be modified to perform malicious behavior with elevated privileges.
T1548,Adversaries may abuse AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges to obtain root privileges in order to install malicious software on victims and install persistence mechanisms.

T1114,Kimsuky has set auto-forward rules on victim's e-mail accounts.
T1114,Silent Librarian has set up auto forwarding rules on compromised e-mail accounts.
T1564,Adversaries may use email rules to hide inbound emails in a compromised user's mailbox.
T1564,"Many email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions, including moving emails to other folders, marking emails as read, or deleting emails."
T1564,Rules may be created or modified within email clients or through external features such as the New-InboxRule or Set-InboxRule PowerShell cmdlets on Windows systems.
T1564,Adversaries may utilize email rules within a compromised user's mailbox to delete and/or move emails to less noticeable folders.
T1564,"Adversaries may do this to hide security alerts, C2 communication, or responses to Internal Spearphishing emails sent from the compromised account."
T1564,Any user or administrator within the organization  may be able to create rules to automatically move or delete emails.
T1564,These rules can be abused to impair/delay detection had the email content been immediately seen by a user or defender.
T1564,Malicious rules commonly filter out emails based on key words  found in message bodies and subject lines.
T1564,"FIN4 has created rules in victims' Microsoft Outlook accounts to automatically delete emails containing words such as “hacked,"" ""phish,"" and “malware"" in a likely attempt to prevent organizations from communicating about their activities."
T1546,Adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by the Event Monitor Daemon .
T1546,"Emond is a Launch Daemon that accepts events from various services, runs them through a simple rules engine, and takes action."
T1546,The emond binary at /sbin/emond will load any rules from the /etc/emond.d/rules/ directory and take action once an explicitly defined event takes place.
T1546,"The rule files are in the plist format and define the name, event type, and action to take."
T1546,Some examples of event types include system startup and user authentication.
T1546,Examples of actions are to run a system command or send an email.
T1546,"The emond service will not launch if there is no file present in the QueueDirectories path /private/var/db/emondClients, specified in the Launch Daemon configuration file at/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.emond.plist."
T1546,"Adversaries may abuse this service by writing a rule to execute commands when a defined event occurs, such as system start up or user authentication."
T1546,Adversaries may also be able to escalate privileges from administrator to root as the emond service is executed with root privileges by the Launch Daemon service.

T1573,Tropic Trooper has encrypted traffic with the C2 to prevent network detection.
T1499,Adversaries may perform Endpoint Denial of Service  attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users.
T1499,Endpoint DoS can be performed by exhausting the system resources those services are hosted on or exploiting the system to cause a persistent crash condition.
T1499,"Example services include websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications."
T1499,"Adversaries have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes and to support other malicious activities, including distraction, hacktivism, and extortion."
T1499,An Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the network used to provide access to the service.
T1499,Adversaries can target various layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide the service.
T1499,"These layers include the Operating Systems , server applications such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the  applications that sit on top of them."
T1499,Attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components.
T1499,"A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS ."
T1499,"To perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets."
T1499,"Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection."
T1499,This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.
T1499,Botnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services.
T1499,Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet.
T1499,"In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources."
T1499,"Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks."
T1499,"In cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the the global network  where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume."
T1499,This type of capability was previously used for the purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traffic was modified to include a reference to JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web servers.
T1499,"For attacks attempting to saturate the providing network, see Network Denial of Service."
T1499,ZxShell has a feature to perform SYN flood attack on a host.
T1499,OnionDuke has the capability to use a Denial of Service module.
T1499,"Sandworm Team temporarily disrupted service to Georgian government, non-government, and private sector websites after compromising a Georgian web hosting provider in 2019."
T1480,Adversaries may environmentally key payloads or other features of malware to evade defenses and constraint execution to a specific target environment.
T1480,Environmental keying uses cryptography to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target.
T1480,Environmental keying is an implementation of Execution Guardrails that utilizes cryptographic techniques for deriving encryption/decryption keys from specific types of values in a given computing environment.
T1480,Values can be derived from target-specific elements and used to generate a decryption key for an encrypted payload.
T1480,"Target-specific values can be derived from specific network shares, physical devices, software/software versions, files, joined AD domains, system time, and local/external IP addresses."
T1480,"By generating the decryption keys from target-specific environmental values, environmental keying can make sandbox detection, anti-virus detection, crowdsourcing of information, and reverse engineering difficult."
T1480,"These difficulties can slow down the incident response process and help adversaries hide their tactics, techniques, and procedures ."
T1480,"Similar to Obfuscated Files or Information, adversaries may use environmental keying to help protect their TTPs and evade detection."
T1480,Environmental keying may be used to deliver an encrypted payload to the target that will use target-specific values to decrypt the payload before execution.
T1480,By utilizing target-specific values to decrypt the payload the adversary can avoid packaging the decryption key with the payload or sending it over a potentially monitored network connection.
T1480,"Depending on the technique for gathering target-specific values, reverse engineering of the encrypted payload can be exceptionally difficult."
T1480,This can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within.
T1480,"Like other Execution Guardrails, environmental keying can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within."
T1480,This activity is distinct from typical Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion.
T1480,"While use of Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of environmental keying will involve checking for an expected target-specific value that must match for decryption and subsequent execution to be successful."
T1480,"InvisiMole can use Data Protection API to encrypt its components on the victim’s computer, to evade detection, and to make sure the payload can only be decrypted and loaded on one specific compromised computer."
T1480,Equation has been observed utilizing environmental keying in payload delivery.
T1480,"APT41 has encrypted payloads using the Data Protection API , which relies on keys tied to specific user accounts on specific machines."
T1480,APT41 has also environmentally keyed second stage malware with an RC5 key derived in part from the infected system's volume serial number.
T1611,Adversaries may break out of a container to gain access to the underlying host.
T1611,This can allow an adversary access to other containerized resources from the host level or to the host itself.
T1611,"In principle, containerized resources should provide a clear separation of application functionality and be isolated from the host environment."
T1611,There are multiple ways an adversary may escape to a host environment.
T1611,"Examples include creating a container configured to mount the host’s filesystem using the bind parameter, which allows the adversary to drop payloads and execute control utilities such as cron on the host, or utilizing a privileged container to run commands on the underlying host."
T1611,"Adversaries may also escape via Exploitation for Privilege Escalation, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in global symbolic links in order to access the root directory of a host machine."
T1611,"Gaining access to the host may provide the adversary with the opportunity to achieve follow-on objectives, such as establishing persistence, moving laterally within the environment, or setting up a command and control channel on the host."
T1611,Doki’s container was configured to bind the host root directory.
T1611,Hildegard has used the BOtB tool that can break out of containers.
T1611,Siloscape maps the host’s C drive to the container by creating a global symbolic link to the host through the calling of NtSetInformationSymbolicLink.
T1611,TeamTNT has deployed privileged containers that mount the filesystem of victim machine.
T1585,Adversaries may create and cultivate accounts with services that can be used during targeting.
T1585,Adversaries can create accounts that can be used to build a persona to further operations.
T1585,"Persona development consists of the development of public information, presence, history and appropriate affiliations."
T1585,"This development could be applied to social media, website, or other publicly available information that could be referenced and scrutinized for legitimacy over the course of an operation using that persona or identity."
T1585,These personas may be fictitious or impersonate real people.
T1585,The persona may exist on a single site or across multiple sites .
T1585,Establishing a persona may require development of additional documentation to make them seem real.
T1585,"This could include filling out profile information, developing social networks, or incorporating photos."
T1585,"Establishing accounts can also include the creation of accounts with email providers, which may be directly leveraged for Phishing for Information or Phishing."
T1585,APT17 has created and cultivated profile pages in Microsoft TechNet.
T1585,"To make profile pages appear more legitimate, APT17 has created biographical sections and posted in forum threads."
T1585,Fox Kitten has created KeyBase accounts to communicate with ransomware victims.
T1546,Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events.
T1546,Various operating systems have means to monitor and subscribe to events such as logons or other user activity such as running specific applications/binaries.
T1546,Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms as a means of maintaining persistent access to a victim via repeatedly executing malicious code.
T1546,"After gaining access to a victim system, adversaries may create/modify event triggers to point to malicious content that will be executed whenever the event trigger is invoked."
T1546,"Since the execution can be proxied by an account with higher permissions, such as SYSTEM or service accounts, an adversary may be able to abuse these triggered execution mechanisms to escalate their privileges."
T1098,"Adversaries may grant additional permission levels, such as ReadPermission or FullAccess, to maintain persistent access to an adversary-controlled email account."
T1098,"The Add-MailboxPermission PowerShell cmdlet, available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service Office 365, adds permissions to a mailbox."
T1098,Adversaries may also assign mailbox folder permissions through individual folder permissions or roles.
T1098,"Adversaries may assign the Default or Anonymous user permissions or roles to the Top of Information Store , Inbox, or other mailbox folders."
T1098,"By assigning one or both user permissions to a folder, the adversary can utilize any other account in the tenant to maintain persistence to the target user’s mail folders."
T1098,This may be used in persistent threat incidents as well as BEC  incidents where an adversary can assign more access rights to the accounts they wish to compromise.
T1098,This may further enable use of additional techniques for gaining access to systems.
T1098,"For example, compromised business accounts are often used to send messages to other accounts in the network of the target business while creating inbox rules , so the messages evade spam/phishing detection mechanisms."
T1098,"UNC2452 added their own devices as allowed IDs for active sync using Set-CASMailbox, allowing it to obtain copies of victim mailboxes."

T1574,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by an installer.
T1574,These processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions.
T1574,"If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process."
T1574,"If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM."
T1574,"Another variation of this technique can be performed by taking advantage of a weakness that is common in executable, self-extracting installers."
T1574,"During the installation process, it is common for installers to use a subdirectory within the %TEMP% directory to unpack binaries such as DLLs, EXEs, or other payloads."
T1574,"When installers create subdirectories and files they often do not set appropriate permissions to restrict write access, which allows for execution of untrusted code placed in the subdirectories or overwriting of binaries used in the installation process."
T1574,This behavior is related to and may take advantage of DLL Search Order Hijacking.
T1574,Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level.
T1574,Some installers may also require elevated privileges that will result in privilege escalation when executing adversary controlled code.
T1574,This behavior is related to Bypass User Account Control.
T1574,Several examples of this weakness in existing common installers have been reported to software vendors.
T1574,If the executing process is set to run at a specific time or during a certain event  then this technique can also be used for persistence.
T1480,Adversaries may use execution guardrails to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied and environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target.
T1480,Guardrails ensure that a payload only executes against an intended target and reduces collateral damage from an adversary’s campaign.
T1480,"Values an adversary can provide about a target system or environment to use as guardrails may include specific network share names, attached physical devices, files, joined Active Directory  domains, and local/external IP addresses."
T1480,Guardrails can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within.
T1480,This use of guardrails is distinct from typical Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion.
T1480,"While use of Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of guardrails will involve checking for an expected target-specific value and only continuing with execution if there is such a match."
T1480,Anchor can terminate itself if specific execution flags are not present.

T1480,"Stuxnet checks for specific operating systems on 32-bit machines, Registry keys, and dates for vulnerabilities, and will exit execution if the values are not met."
T1480,APT33 has used kill dates in their malware to guardrail execution.
T1048,Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over a different protocol than that of the existing command and control channel.
T1048,The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server.
T1048,"Alternate protocols include FTP, SMTP, HTTP/S, DNS, SMB, or any other network protocol not being used as the main command and control channel."
T1048,Different protocol channels could also include Web services such as cloud storage.

T1048,Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an asymmetrically encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel.
T1048,Asymmetric encryption algorithms are those that use different keys on each end of the channel.
T1048,"Also known as public-key cryptography, this requires pairs of cryptographic keys that can encrypt/decrypt data from the corresponding key."
T1048,Each end of the communication channels requires a private key  and the public key of the other entity.
T1048,The public keys of each entity are exchanged before encrypted communications begin.
T1048,Network protocols that use asymmetric encryption  often utilize symmetric encryption once keys are exchanged.
T1048,Adversaries may opt to use these encrypted mechanisms that are baked into a protocol.

T1203,"Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility."
T1203,"Several types exist:
### Browser-based Exploitation
Web browsers are a common target through Drive-by Compromise and Spearphishing Link."
T1203,Endpoint systems may be compromised through normal web browsing or from certain users being targeted by links in spearphishing emails to adversary controlled sites used to exploit the web browser.
T1203,These often do not require an action by the user for the exploit to be executed.
T1203,"### Office Applications
Common office and productivity applications such as Microsoft Office are also targeted through Phishing."
T1203,Malicious files will be transmitted directly as attachments or through links to download them.
T1203,These require the user to open the document or file for the exploit to run.

T1491,Externally-facing websites are a common victim of defacement; often targeted by adversary and hacktivist groups in order to push a political message or spread propaganda.
T1491,"External Defacement may be used as a catalyst to trigger events, or as a response to actions taken by an organization or government."
T1491,"Similarly, website defacement may also be used as setup, or a precursor, for future attacks such as Drive-by Compromise."
T1491,"Sandworm Team defaced approximately 15,000 websites belonging to Georgian government, non-government, and private sector organizations in 2019."
T1090,Adversaries may use an external proxy to act as an intermediary for network communications to a command and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure.
T1090,"Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including HTRAN, ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap."
T1090,"Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command and control communications, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths to avoid suspicion."
T1090,External connection proxies are used to mask the destination of C2 traffic and are typically implemented with port redirectors.
T1090,"Compromised systems outside of the victim environment may be used for these purposes, as well as purchased infrastructure such as cloud-based resources or virtual private servers."
T1090,Proxies may be chosen based on the low likelihood that a connection to them from a compromised system would be investigated.
T1090,Victim systems would communicate directly with the external proxy on the Internet and then the proxy would forward communications to the C2 server.

T1055,Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via Extra Window Memory  in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
T1055,EWM injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
T1055,"Before creating a window, graphical Windows-based processes must prescribe to or register a windows class, which stipulate appearance and behavior ."
T1055,Registration of new windows classes can include a request for up to 40 bytes of EWM to be appended to the allocated memory of each instance of that class.
T1055,This EWM is intended to store data specific to that window and has specific application programming interface  functions to set and get its value.
T1055,"Although small, the EWM is large enough to store a 32-bit pointer and is often used to point to a windows procedure."
T1055,"Malware may possibly utilize this memory location in part of an attack chain that includes writing code to shared sections of the process’s memory, placing a pointer to the code in EWM, then invoking execution by returning execution control to the address in the process’s EWM."
T1055,Execution granted through EWM injection may allow access to both the target process's memory and possibly elevated privileges.
T1055,Writing payloads to shared sections also avoids the use of highly monitored API calls such as WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread.
T1055,More sophisticated malware samples may also potentially bypass protection mechanisms such as data execution prevention  by triggering a combination of windows procedures and other system functions that will rewrite the malicious payload inside an executable portion of the target process.
T1055,Execution via EWM injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
T1055,Power Loader overwrites Explorer’s Shell_TrayWnd extra window memory to redirect execution to a NTDLL function that is abused to assemble and execute a return-oriented programming  chain and create a malicious thread within Explorer.exe.
T1055,Epic has overwritten the function pointer in the extra window memory of Explorer's Shell_TrayWnd in order to execute malicious code in the context of the explorer.exe process.

T1495,"TrickBot module ""Trickboot"" can write or erase the UEFI/BIOS firmware of a compromised device."
T1187,Adversaries may gather credential material by invoking or forcing a user to automatically provide authentication information through a mechanism in which they can intercept.
T1187,The Server Message Block  protocol is commonly used in Windows networks for authentication and communication between systems for access to resources and file sharing.
T1187,When a Windows system attempts to connect to an SMB resource it will automatically attempt to authenticate and send credential information for the current user to the remote system.
T1187,This behavior is typical in enterprise environments so that users do not need to enter credentials to access network resources.
T1187,Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning  is also typically used by Windows systems as a backup protocol when SMB is blocked or fails.
T1187,WebDAV is an extension of HTTP and will typically operate over TCP ports 80 and 443.
T1187,Adversaries may take advantage of this behavior to gain access to user account hashes through forced SMB/WebDAV authentication.
T1187,"An adversary can send an attachment to a user through spearphishing that contains a resource link to an external server controlled by the adversary  Template Injection, or place a specially crafted file on navigation path for privileged accounts  or on a publicly accessible share to be accessed by victim."
T1187,"When the user's system accesses the untrusted resource it will attempt authentication and send information, including the user's hashed credentials, over SMB to the adversary controlled server."
T1187,"With access to the credential hash, an adversary can perform off-line Brute Force cracking to gain access to plaintext credentials."
T1187,There are several different ways this can occur.
T1187,"Some specifics from in-the-wild use include:
* A spearphishing attachment containing a document with a resource that is automatically loaded when the document is opened  Template Injection."
T1187,"The document can include, for example, a request similar to file://remote address/Normal.dotm to trigger the SMB request."
T1187,* A modified .LNK or .SCF file with the icon filename pointing to an external reference such as \\remote address\pic.png that will force the system to load the resource when the icon is rendered to repeatedly gather credentials.
T1187,EnvyScout can use protocol handlers to coax the operating system to send NTLMv2 authentication responses to attacker-controlled infrastructure.
T1187,DarkHydrus used Template Injection to launch an authentication window for users to enter their credentials.

T1606,Adversaries may forge credential materials that can be used to gain access to web applications or Internet services.
T1606,"Web applications and services  often use session cookies, tokens, or other materials to authenticate and authorize user access."
T1606,Adversaries may generate these credential materials in order to gain access to web resources.
T1606,"This differs from Steal Web Session Cookie, Steal Application Access Token, and other similar behaviors in that the credentials are new and forged by the adversary, rather than stolen or intercepted from legitimate users."
T1606,"The generation of web credentials often requires secret values, such as passwords, Private Keys, or other cryptographic seed values."
T1606,"Once forged, adversaries may use these web credentials to access resources , which may bypass multi-factor and other authentication protection mechanisms."
T1056,Adversaries may mimic common operating system GUI components to prompt users for credentials with a seemingly legitimate prompt.
T1056,"When programs are executed that need additional privileges than are present in the current user context, it is common for the operating system to prompt the user for proper credentials to authorize the elevated privileges for the task ."
T1056,"Adversaries may mimic this functionality to prompt users for credentials with a seemingly legitimate prompt for a number of reasons that mimic normal usage, such as a fake installer requiring additional access or a fake malware removal suite."
T1056,This type of prompt can be used to collect credentials via various languages such as AppleScript and PowerShell.

T1553,Adversaries may modify file attributes that signify programs are from untrusted sources to subvert Gatekeeper controls in macOS.
T1553,"When documents, applications, or programs are downloaded an extended attribute  called com.apple.quarantine can be set on the file by the application performing the download."
T1553,"This attribute, also known as a quarantine flag, is read by Apple's Gatekeeper defense program when the file is run and provides a prompt to the user to allow or deny execution."
T1553,"Gatekeeper also monitors an application's usage of dynamic libraries  loaded outside the application folder on any quarantined binary, often using the dlopen function."
T1553,"If the quarantine flag is set in macOS 10.15+, Gatekeeper also checks for a notarization ticket and sends a cryptographic hash to Apple's servers to check for validity for all unsigned executables."
T1553,The quarantine flag is an opt-in system and not imposed by macOS.
T1553,"If an application opts-in, a file downloaded from the Internet will be given a quarantine flag before being saved to disk."
T1553,Any application or user with write permissions to the file can change or strip the quarantine flag.
T1553,"With elevated permission , this attribute can be removed from any file."
T1553,The presence of the com.apple.quarantine quarantine flag can be checked with the xattr command xattr -l /path/to/examplefile.
T1553,"Similarly, this attribute can be recursively removed from all files in a folder using xattr, sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/folder."
T1553,"Apps and files loaded onto the system from a USB flash drive, optical disk, external hard drive, from a drive shared over the local network, or using the curl command do not set this flag."
T1553,"Additionally, it is possible to avoid setting this flag using Drive-by Compromise, which may bypass Gatekeeper."
T1553,"CoinTicker downloads the EggShell mach-o binary using curl, which does not set the quarantine flag."
T1553,OSX_OCEANLOTUS.D uses the command xattr -d com.apple.quarantine to remove the quarantine file attribute used by Gatekeeper and Notarization checks.
T1553,"If running with elevated privileges, OSX/Shlayer uses the spctl command to disable Gatekeeper protection for a downloaded file."
T1553,"OSX/Shlayer also leveraged system links pointing to bash scripts in the downloaded DMG file to bypass Gatekeeper, a flaw patched in macOS 11.3 and later versions."

T1484,GPOs are containers for group policy settings made up of files stored within a predicable network path \\&lt;DOMAIN&gt;\SYSVOL\&lt;DOMAIN&gt;\Policies\.
T1484,"Like other objects in AD, GPOs have access controls associated with them."
T1484,By default all user accounts in the domain have permission to read GPOs.
T1484,"It is possible to delegate GPO access control permissions, e.g."
T1484,"write access, to specific users or groups in the domain."
T1484,"Malicious GPO modifications can be used to implement many other malicious behaviors such as Scheduled Task/Job, Disable or Modify Tools, Ingress Tool Transfer, Create Account, Service Execution,  and more."
T1484,"Since GPOs can control so many user and machine settings in the AD environment, there are a great number of potential attacks that can stem from this GPO abuse."
T1484,"For example, publicly available scripts such as New-GPOImmediateTask can be leveraged to automate the creation of a malicious Scheduled Task/Job by modifying GPO settings, in this case modifying &lt;GPO_PATH&gt;\Machine\Preferences\ScheduledTasks\ScheduledTasks.xml."
T1484,"In some cases an adversary might modify specific user rights like SeEnableDelegationPrivilege, set in &lt;GPO_PATH&gt;\MACHINE\Microsoft\Windows NT\SecEdit\GptTmpl.inf, to achieve a subtle AD backdoor with complete control of the domain because the user account under the adversary's control would then be able to modify GPOs."

 APT33 has used a variety of publicly available tools like Gpppassword to gather credentials."
T1027,Adversaries may smuggle data and files past content filters by hiding malicious payloads inside of seemingly benign HTML files.
T1027,HTML documents can store large binary objects known as JavaScript Blobs  that can later be constructed into file-like objects.
T1027,"Data may also be stored in Data URLs, which enable embedding media type or MIME files inline of HTML documents."
T1027,HTML5 also introduced a download attribute that may be used to initiate file downloads.
T1027,Adversaries may deliver payloads to victims that bypass security controls through HTML Smuggling by abusing JavaScript Blobs and/or HTML5 download attributes.
T1027,"Security controls such as web content filters may not identify smuggled malicious files inside of HTML/JS files, as the content may be based on typically benign MIME types such as text/plain and/or text/html."
T1027,"Malicious files or data can be obfuscated and hidden inside of HTML files through Data URLs and/or JavaScript Blobs and can be deobfuscated when they reach the victim  Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information, potentially bypassing content filters."

T1564,Normal users may want to hide users when there are many users accounts on a given system or want to keep an account hidden from the other users on the system.
T1564,"In macOS, every user account has a userID associated with it."
T1564,"When creating a user, you can specify the userID for that account."
T1564,There is a property value in /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow called Hide500Users that prevents users with userIDs 500 and lower from appearing at the login screen.
T1564,"When using the Create Account technique with a userID under 500  and enabling this property , an adversary can conceal user accounts."
T1564,"In Windows, adversaries may hide user accounts via settings in the Registry."
T1564,"For example, an adversary may add a value to the Windows Registry  or other means that will hide the user “test” from the Windows login screen: reg.exe ADD 'HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccountsUserList' /v test /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f."

T1564,Adversaries may attempt to hide artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection.
T1564,"Operating systems may have features to hide various artifacts, such as important system files and administrative task execution, to avoid disrupting user work environments and prevent users from changing files or features on the system."
T1564,"Adversaries may abuse these features to hide artifacts such as files, directories, user accounts, or other system activity to evade detection."
T1564,"Adversaries may also attempt to hide artifacts associated with malicious behavior by creating computing regions that are isolated from common security instrumentation, such as through the use of virtualization technology."
T1564,"Bundlore uses the mktemp utility to make unique file and directory names for payloads, such as TMP_DIR=`mktemp -d -t x. OSX/Shlayer uses the mktemp utility to make random and unique filenames for payloads, such as export tmpDir=""$"" or mktemp -t Installer."
T1574,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs.
T1574,"Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence, since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time."
T1574,"Adversaries may also use these mechanisms to elevate privileges or evade defenses, such as application control or other restrictions on execution."
T1574,"There are many ways an adversary may hijack the flow of execution, including by manipulating how the operating system locates programs to be executed."
T1574,How the operating system locates libraries to be used by a program can also be intercepted.

T1505,Adversaries may install malicious components that run on Internet Information Services  web servers to establish persistence.
T1505,IIS provides several mechanisms to extend the functionality of the web servers.
T1505,"For example, Internet Server Application Programming Interface  extensions and filters can be installed to examine and/or modify incoming and outgoing IIS web requests."
T1505,"Extensions and filters are deployed as DLL files that export three functions: Get{Extension/Filter}Version, Http{Extension/Filter}Proc, and  Terminate{Extension/Filter}."
T1505,IIS modules may also be installed to extend IIS web servers.
T1505,"Adversaries may install malicious ISAPI extensions and filters to observe and/or modify traffic, execute commands on compromised machines, or proxy command and control traffic."
T1505,ISAPI extensions and filters may have access to all IIS web requests and responses.
T1505,"For example, an adversary may abuse these mechanisms to modify HTTP responses in order to distribute malicious commands/content to previously comprised hosts."
T1505,Adversaries may also install malicious IIS modules to observe and/or modify traffic.
T1505,IIS 7.0 introduced modules that provide the same unrestricted access to HTTP requests and responses as ISAPI extensions and filters.
T1505,"IIS modules can be written as a DLL that exports RegisterModule, or as a .NET application that interfaces with ASP.NET APIs to access IIS HTTP requests."

T1591,Adversaries may gather information about the victim's business tempo that can be used during targeting.
T1591,"Information about an organization’s business tempo may include a variety of details, including operational hours/days of the week."
T1591,This information may also reveal times/dates of purchases and shipments of the victim’s hardware and software resources.
T1591,Information about business tempo may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets  or Search Victim-Owned Websites.
T1591,"Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance  or Search Open Websites/Domains, establishing operational resources  or Compromise Accounts, and/or initial access  or Trusted Relationship"
T1591,Adversaries may gather information about identities and roles within the victim organization that can be used during targeting.

T1546,Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by Image File Execution Options  debuggers.
T1546,IFEOs enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application.
T1546,"When a process is created, a debugger present in an application’s IFEO will be prepended to the application’s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger ."
T1546,IFEOs can be set directly via the Registry or in Global Flags via the GFlags tool.
T1546,IFEOs are represented as Debugger values in the Registry under HKLM\SOFTWARE{\Wow6432Node}\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\<executable> where &lt;executable&gt; is the binary on which the debugger is attached.
T1546,"IFEOs can also enable an arbitrary monitor program to be launched when a specified program silently exits  is prematurely terminated by itself or a second, non kernel-mode process."
T1546,"Similar to debuggers, silent exit monitoring can be enabled through GFlags and/or by directly modifying IFEO and silent process exit Registry values in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\."
T1546,"Similar to Accessibility Features, on Windows Vista and later as well as Windows Server 2008 and later, a Registry key may be modified that configures ""cmd.exe,"" or another program that provides backdoor access, as a ""debugger"" for an accessibility program ."
T1546,"After the Registry is modified, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while at the keyboard or when connected with Remote Desktop Protocol will cause the ""debugger"" program to be executed with SYSTEM privileges."
T1546,"Similar to Process Injection, these values may also be abused to obtain privilege escalation by causing a malicious executable to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer."
T1546,Installing IFEO mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous triggered invocation.
T1546,Malware may also use IFEO to Impair Defenses by registering invalid debuggers that redirect and effectively disable various system and security applications.
T1546,SDBbot has the ability to use image file execution options for persistence if it detects it is running with admin privileges on a Windows version newer than Windows 7.

T1546,TEMP.Veles has modified and added entries within HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options to maintain persistence.
T1562,Adversaries may impair command history logging to hide commands they run on a compromised system.
T1562,"On Linux and macOS, command history is tracked in a file pointed to by the environment variable HISTFILE."
T1562,The HISTCONTROL environment variable keeps track of what should be saved by the history command and eventually into the ~/.bash_history file when a user logs out.
T1562,"HISTCONTROL does not exist by default on macOS, but can be set by the user and will be respected."
T1562,Adversaries may clear the history environment variable  or set the command history size to zero  to prevent logging of commands.
T1562,"Additionally, HISTCONTROL can be configured to ignore commands that start with a space by simply setting it to ""ignorespace""."
T1562,"HISTCONTROL can also be set to ignore duplicate commands by setting it to ""ignoredups""."
T1562,"In some Linux systems, this is set by default to ""ignoreboth"" which covers both of the previous examples."
T1562,"This means that “ ls” will not be saved, but “ls” would be saved by history."
T1562,Adversaries can abuse this to operate without leaving traces by simply prepending a space to all of their terminal commands.
T1562,"On Windows systems, the PSReadLine module tracks commands used in all PowerShell sessions and writes them to a file ."
T1562,Adversaries may change where these logs are saved using Set-PSReadLineOption -HistorySavePath {File Path}.
T1562,This will cause ConsoleHost_history.txt to stop receiving logs.
T1562,"Additionally, it is possible to turn off logging to this file using the PowerShell command Set-PSReadlineOption -HistorySaveStyle SaveNothing."
T1562,APT38 has prepended a space to all of their terminal commands to operate without leaving traces in the HISTCONTROL environment.
T1562,Adversaries may maliciously modify components of a victim environment in order to hinder or disable defensive mechanisms.
T1562,"This not only involves impairing preventative defenses, such as firewalls and anti-virus, but also detection capabilities that defenders can use to audit activity and identify malicious behavior."
T1562,This may also span both native defenses as well as supplemental capabilities installed by users and administrators.
T1562,"Adversaries could also target event aggregation and analysis mechanisms, or otherwise disrupt these procedures by altering other system components."
T1562,Stuxnet reduces the integrity level of objects to allow write actions.
T1525,Adversaries may implant cloud or container images with malicious code to establish persistence after gaining access to an environment.
T1525,"Amazon Web Services  Amazon Machine Images , Google Cloud Platform  Images, and Azure Images as well as popular container runtimes such as Docker can be implanted or backdoored."
T1525,"Unlike Upload Malware, this technique focuses on adversaries implanting an image in a registry within a victim’s environment."
T1525,"Depending on how the infrastructure is provisioned, this could provide persistent access if the infrastructure provisioning tool is instructed to always use the latest image."
T1525,A tool has been developed to facilitate planting backdoors in cloud container images.
T1525,"If an attacker has access to a compromised AWS instance, and permissions to list the available container images, they may implant a backdoor such as a Web Shell."
T1562,An adversary may attempt to block indicators or events typically captured by sensors from being gathered and analyzed.
T1562,"This could include maliciously redirecting  or even disabling host-based sensors, such as Event Tracing for Windows , by tampering settings that control the collection and flow of event telemetry."
T1562,These settings may be stored on the system in configuration files and/or in the Registry as well as being accessible via administrative utilities such as PowerShell or Windows Management Instrumentation.
T1562,"ETW interruption can be achieved multiple ways, however most directly by defining conditions using the PowerShell Set-EtwTraceProvider cmdlet or by interfacing directly with the Registry to make alterations."
T1562,"In the case of network-based reporting of indicators, an adversary may block traffic associated with reporting to prevent central analysis."
T1562,"This may be accomplished by many means, such as stopping a local process responsible for forwarding telemetry and/or creating a host-based firewall rule to block traffic to specific hosts responsible for aggregating events, such as security information and event management  products."
T1562,Ebury can hook logging functions so that nothing from the backdoor gets sent to the logging facility.
T1562,Waterbear can hook the ZwOpenProcess and GetExtendedTcpTable APIs called by the process of a security product to hide PIDs and TCP records from detection.
T1027,"Adversaries may remove indicators from tools if they believe their malicious tool was detected, quarantined, or otherwise curtailed."
T1027,They can modify the tool by removing the indicator and using the updated version that is no longer detected by the target's defensive systems or subsequent targets that may use similar systems.
T1027,A good example of this is when malware is detected with a file signature and quarantined by anti-virus software.
T1027,"An adversary who can determine that the malware was quarantined because of its file signature may modify the file to explicitly avoid that signature, and then re-use the malware."
T1027,"The author of GravityRAT submitted samples to VirusTotal for testing, showing that the author modified the code to try to hide the DDE object in a different part of the document."
T1027,Analysis of Daserf has shown that it regularly undergoes technical improvements to evade anti-virus detection.

T1553,Adversaries may install a root certificate on a compromised system to avoid warnings when connecting to adversary controlled web servers.
T1553,Root certificates are used in public key cryptography to identify a root certificate authority .
T1553,"When a root certificate is installed, the system or application will trust certificates in the root's chain of trust that have been signed by the root certificate."
T1553,Certificates are commonly used for establishing secure TLS/SSL communications within a web browser.
T1553,When a user attempts to browse a website that presents a certificate that is not trusted an error message will be displayed to warn the user of the security risk.
T1553,"Depending on the security settings, the browser may not allow the user to establish a connection to the website."
T1553,Installation of a root certificate on a compromised system would give an adversary a way to degrade the security of that system.
T1553,Adversaries have used this technique to avoid security warnings prompting users when compromised systems connect over HTTPS to adversary controlled web servers that spoof legitimate websites in order to collect login credentials.
T1553,Atypical root certificates have also been pre-installed on systems by the manufacturer or in the software supply chain and were used in conjunction with malware/adware to provide Adversary-in-the-Middle capability for intercepting information transmitted over secure TLS/SSL communications.
T1553,Root certificates  can also be cloned and reinstalled.
T1553,Cloned certificate chains will carry many of the same metadata characteristics of the source and can be used to sign malicious code that may then bypass signature validation tools  used to block execution and/or uncover artifacts of Persistence.
T1553,"In macOS, the Ay MaMi malware uses /usr/bin/security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /path/to/malicious/cert to install a malicious certificate as a trusted root certificate into the system keychain."

T1534,Internal spearphishing is multi-staged attack where an email account is owned either by controlling the user's device with previously installed malware or by compromising the account credentials of the user.
T1534,Adversaries attempt to take advantage of a trusted internal account to increase the likelihood of tricking the target into falling for the phish attempt.
T1534,Adversaries may leverage Spearphishing Attachment or Spearphishing Link as part of internal spearphishing to deliver a payload or redirect to an external site to capture credentials through Input Capture on sites that mimic email login interfaces.
T1534,There have been notable incidents where internal spearphishing has been used.
T1534,"The Eye Pyramid campaign used phishing emails with malicious attachments for lateral movement between victims, compromising nearly 18,000 email accounts in the process."
T1534,The Syrian Electronic Army  compromised email accounts at the Financial Times  to steal additional account credentials.
