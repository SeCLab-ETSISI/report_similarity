587,T1499,An Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the network used to provide access to the service.,112
588,T1499,Attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components.,112
589,T1499,"In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources.",112
590,T1499,"In cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the the global network  where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume.",112
591,T1480,Environmental keying uses cryptography to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target.,100
592,T1480,"Target-specific values can be derived from specific network shares, physical devices, software/software versions, files, joined AD domains, system time, and local/external IP addresses.",100
593,T1480,By utilizing target-specific values to decrypt the payload the adversary can avoid packaging the decryption key with the payload or sending it over a potentially monitored network connection.,100
594,T1611,"Examples include creating a container configured to mount the host’s filesystem using the bind parameter, which allows the adversary to drop payloads and execute control utilities such as cron on the host, or utilizing a privileged container to run commands on the underlying host.",181
595,T1611,"Adversaries may also escape via Exploitation for Privilege Escalation, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in global symbolic links in order to access the root directory of a host machine.",181
596,T1585,These personas may be fictitious or impersonate real people.,159
597,T1585,The persona may exist on a single site or across multiple sites .,159
598,T1546,Various operating systems have means to monitor and subscribe to events such as logons or other user activity such as running specific applications/binaries.,128
599,T1546,Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms as a means of maintaining persistent access to a victim via repeatedly executing malicious code.,128
600,T1546,"Since the execution can be proxied by an account with higher permissions, such as SYSTEM or service accounts, an adversary may be able to abuse these triggered execution mechanisms to escalate their privileges.",128
601,T1098,This may be used in persistent threat incidents as well as BEC  incidents where an adversary can assign more access rights to the accounts they wish to compromise.,49
602,T1098,This may further enable use of additional techniques for gaining access to systems.,49
603,T1098,"UNC2452 added their own devices as allowed IDs for active sync using Set-CASMailbox, allowing it to obtain copies of victim mailboxes.",49
604,T1574,Some installers may also require elevated privileges that will result in privilege escalation when executing adversary controlled code.,154
